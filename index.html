                  Emily Jane Brontë an English novelist and poet, was born in
                  July, 1818 in Thornton, Yorkshire, England. Emily was part of
                  a talented literary family. Her sisters, Charlotte and Anne,
                  also became well-known writers.

                  Emily’s formal education began when she attended the Clergy
                  Daughters’ School at Cowan Bridge, but she was later removed
                  from the school along with her sisters due to poor conditions
                  and the outbreak of tuberculosis. After leaving the school,
                  Emily was primarily educated at home by her father.

                  Emily Brontë’s literary career is primarily centered around
                  “Wuthering Heights” which was published in 1847 under the
                  pseudonym Ellis Bell.

                  The novel is known for its dark, passionate characters and its
                  exploration of themes such as love, revenge, and the
                  supernatural. Despite initial mixed reviews, “Wuthering
                  Heights” gained popularity over time and is now considered one
                  of the greatest novels in the English language.

                  Emily Brontë led a relatively secluded life, spending much of
                  her time with her family at the parsonage in Haworth,
                  Yorkshire. She was known for her love of nature and her
                  solitary nature. Her experiences growing up in the rugged
                  Yorkshire moors greatly influenced her writing, providing the
                  atmospheric backdrop for her novels.

                  died of tuberculosis in December 1848 at the age of 30, just
                  one year after the publication of “Wuthering Heights.”

                  “Wuthering Heights” is a timeless classic of English
                  literature, written by Emily Brontë and published in 1847. Set
                  against the atmospheric backdrop of the Yorkshire moors,
                  Brontë’s only novel is tackled the haunting tale of love,
                  revenge, and the destructive power of passion.

                  At its heart, “Wuthering Heights” explores the tumultuous
                  relationships between the inhabitants of two neighboring
                  households: the Earnshaws of Wuthering Heights and the Lintons
                  of Thrushcross Grange. Through the eyes of the narrator, Mr.
                  Lockwood, and later through the recollections of the
                  housekeeper, Nelly Dean, the reader is drawn into a complex
                  web of family secrets, forbidden love, and vengeful obsession.

                  Central to the novel is the passionate and destructive love
                  between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, an orphaned boy
                  taken in by the Earnshaw family. Their bond defies social
                  conventions and transcends mere affection, but it is also
                  marked by jealousy, manipulation, and cruelty.

                  As the story unfolds, Brontë delves deep into the dark
                  recesses of the human psyche, exploring themes of class
                  conflict, revenge, and the cyclical nature of violence.

                  The novel’s setting plays a crucial role in shaping its mood
                  and atmosphere. The desolate Yorkshire moors mirror the wild
                  and untamed emotions of the characters, while the isolated and
                  windswept landscape serves as a metaphor for their turbulent
                  inner lives.

                  From the imposing presence of the titular Wuthering Heights to

                  society and the characters themselves.

                  In the year 1801, having just returned from visiting my

                  find myself in a location far away from society, slightly
                  solitary, yet its innate charm captivates me. This place

                  While crossing the threshold, I came to notice some strange On
                  the main door and among them, two words: “1500” and “Hareton
                  Earnshaw.” This aroused my curiosity to know something of the
                  history of this place from its owner, but his gruff and
                  impatient manner <strong>put me off</strong>.

                  One more step brought us into the family’s sitting room, which
                  they call here the house. It included a kitchen and a parlour,
                  but here, the kitchen seemed shifted inside, as I did not see
                  any sign of roasting, boiling or baking near the huge
                  fireplace.

                  Besides, I could hear the clutter of utensils and feminine
                  voices coming from inside. At the other end of the room,
                  however, I could see rows of dishes, silver jugs and
                  <strong>tankards</strong> stacked up to the roof.

                  The apartment and furniture looked typically like of a
                  northern farmer’s, but the owner stood in complete contrast to
                  them. His appearance was that of a <strong>gypsy</strong>, but
                  he was dressed and had the manners of a gentleman. His look
                  was unhappy, with a hint of ill-bred pride. As we settled in
                  our seats across each other, he ordered Joseph to bring some
                  tea.

                  Probably with a view to being nice to his tenant, he started a

                  As I took his leave, I had made up my mind to pay him another
                  visit the next day. The following afternoon was cold, and I
                  reached the Heights just in time to escape the first flakes of

                  Beside the fire, I was pleased to notice a young miss whose

                  waited for a seat to be offered, but she kept looking fixedly

                  She was fair, with a round and pretty face, and golden locks
                  hanging loosely around her neck. She had beautiful eyes, but

                  too, as those of a labourer, his <strong>bearing</strong> was

                  The business of eating being over, I approached a window to
                  examine the weather. It was sorrowful. The night was
                  descending early, and a cold, bitter wind was blowing. A storm

                  Heathcliff told Zillah to give me a glass of water and then

                  resembling windows. In fact, it formed a little closet, and

                  hand had closed upon it. I tried to draw back my arm, but the

                  his hands, and his <strong>agitation</strong> was so extreme
                  that he could hardly pick it up. “It is only your guest, sir,”

                  of work and, drawing her seat near, began — Before I came to
                  live here, I mostly stayed at Wuthering Heights, because my
                  mother raised Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, Hareton’s father, and I
                  used to play with the children. One fine morning, as Mr.
                  Earnshaw, the old master, was about to go to Liverpool, he
                  instructed Joseph about the day’s work. And after kissing
                  goodbye his children, Catherine and Hindley, he set off for
                  the journey.

                  That boy was Heathcliff, and this was Heathcliff’s first
                  introduction to the family. Soon, Cathy and Heathcliff became
                  very friendly, but Hindley hated him. Hindley’s cruelties to
                  him only made Heathcliff dearer to my master. Heathcliff
                  himself was a <strong>sullen, ill-disposed</strong> child, and
                  I could never understand why my master had taken a fancy to
                  him. Heathcliff was not <strong>insolent</strong> to his
                  <strong>benefactor</strong>, but simply insensible and never
                  showed any sign of gratitude. Knowing perfectly what hold he
                  had on Mr. Earnshaw’s heart and conscience, he had only to
                  speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his

                  Over time, Mr. Earnshaw’s health began to fail, and he grew
                  more possessive towards Heathcliff, his object of affection.
                  Any insult to Heathcliff on Hindley’s part drove the old man
                  to fury, with the result that Heathcliff’s pride and black
                  temper grew more vicious. Lastly, our priest, as a solution,
                  suggested that Hindley be sent to college, and Mr. Earnshaw
                  agreed.

                  One October evening, Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair.
                  The house was without a master now. When the news reached
                  Hindley, he arrived for the funeral with a wife, much to the
                  amazement of all.

                  On his return, Hindley settled himself as the master of the
                  house. On the very first occasion, he told Joseph and me that
                  we must move to the back kitchen.

                  He had the air of a man of the world now. His wife expressed
                  pleasure at having Catherine as a sister-in-law, and gave her
                  many presents. But her affections tired very soon, and she
                  became easily annoyed. Hindley, too, grew
                  <strong>tyrannical</strong>.

                  After Mr. Earnshaw’s death, Hindley remembered his father as
                  an <strong>oppressor</strong> and saw Heathcliff as a
                  <strong>usurper</strong> of his parent’s affections and
                  privileges. A few words from his wife indicating her dislike
                  for Heathcliff were sufficient to arouse all his hatred for
                  the boy. He drove him from their company and forced him to
                  work outdoors as hard as any other boy on the farm.

                  Heathcliff bore his <strong>degradation</strong> rather
                  easily, because Catherine told him what she learnt and also
                  played with him in the fields. They both promised to grow up
                  as rude as savages, Hindley being entirely negligent of all
                  this as they kept clear of him.

                  One Sunday evening, Heathcliff and Cathy were banished from
                  the sitting room for making some noise. At supper time, they
                  could not be found anywhere. Their wild uncontrollable manners
                  gave me a clue of the hard times to come. I retired to bed
                  with a heavy heart.

                  On a fine June day, a little baby was born to Mr. Hindley, but
                  the mother died soon after. I was now to nurse the child
                  called Hareton. Mr. Hindley saw the little baby was healthy,
                  and never heard him cry, so he remained contented.

                  Hindley’s treatment of Heathcliff now was enough to make an
                  enemy of even a saint. The house had indeed become infernal.
                  The <strong>curate</strong> stopped calling, and nobody decent
                  came near us except Edgar Linton, son of Mr. Linton of
                  Thrushcross Grange, who had lately been quite impressed with
                  Cathy’s beauty. At fifteen, she was the queen of the
                  countryside, but she was a naughty and headstrong creature.

                  In fact, even I did not like her arrogance. Heathcliff kept
                  his hold on Cathy’s affections, and the young Linton found it
                  difficult to make an equally deep impression on her with all
                  his superiority.
                  <br />
                  Edgar Linton was always received with civility in Wuthering
                  Heights, but his visits had started a struggle inside
                  Catherine. All the gentlemanly ways of Edgar necessitated that
                  Cathy too behaved accordingly, but the rustic and unpolished
                  temperament within her found it difficult to cope with this.

                  Both she and Heathcliff poured <strong>contempt</strong> on
                  him in his absence. But when Edgar showed disgust for and
                  <strong>antipathy</strong> to Heathcliff in some measure, she
                  had to accept it. Edgar’s visits troubled her as she found it
                  difficult to keep a double character. I knew of her
                  <strong>perplexities</strong> but did not say anything until
                  one day she came to me herself.

                  Mr. Hindley was not at home one afternoon, and Heathcliff had

                Steerforth had laughed in church, but it was Traddles who was
                accused and severely punished.

                Traddles did not tell Mr. Creakle who had really laughed and the
                poor boy was locked up for many hours. Steerforth said that
                Traddles was a good friend and Traddles was happy with these
                words of praise.

                I believe that no man had ever enjoyed his
                <strong>profession</strong> more than Mr. Creakle. He delighted
                in hitting and marking the boys, especially the younger ones. I
                remember the look in his eye when he was hitting the boys and
                then watching them try to rub away the marks with their
                handkerchiefs.

                One good thing came of my beatings. Mr. Creakle realised that my
                sign was in his way when he wanted to hit me with the ruler and
                so it was taken off and I did not have to wear it again

                Sometimes at night, before we fell asleep, I told stories to
                Steerforth which he really seemed to enjoy. The more imaginative
                and impossible, the better. One day I received a wonderful
                letter from Peggotty, together with a cake in a perfect nest of
                oranges. I laid this feast at Steerforth’s feet and asked him to
                share it out to the boys in our room.

                In a school carried on by sheer cruelty, it was very difficult
                to <strong>concentrate</strong> on learning. Most of the boys
                were very <strong>ignorant</strong>
                because they were always worried and afraid of being beaten.
                With Steerforth’s help, I made use of my time at Salem House and
                managed to learn quite a lot of useful information, despite the
                loneliness and the cruelty of the school.

                I was very pleased when I was with Mr. Mell. He liked me and
                taught a lot of subjects. I am sad when I remember how rudely
                Steerforth treated him and encouraged other boys to do so. This
                troubled me a lot, especially as I had told Steerforth about the
                old woman that Mr. Mell had taken me to see.

                I was always afraid that Steerforth would mention this visit and
                torment him with it. I was right to be afraid. One day, when Mr.
                Creakle was absent, there was a lot of noise coming from the
                classroom. We were always much happier when Mr. Creakle was not
                around.

                It was Saturday and as Mr. Sharp was out getting his wig curled,
                Mr. Mell was in charge of the school. The boys started jumping
                out of their seats, making faces and mimicking Mr. Mell’s
                poverty, his boots, his coat and his mother.

                Steerforth of hurting Mr. Mell’s feelings and making him lose
                his job. I think that Steerforth felt bad about what happened to
                Mr. Mell. He said that he would write to his mother to see that
                Mr. Mell received some money.

                I told Mr. Peggotty that Steerforth was my friend and that he

                told him about Peggotty’s house. “You never saw such an amazing

                My mother thanked her for her love and loyalty and Peggotty
                covered her head with the apron again. The baby was fed and the
                dishes cleared away and the three of us sat in front of the
                fire. I told them about Mr. Creakle and Steerforth and about my
                life at Salem House School.

                We were so happy that evening, just the three of us. It was the

                Later that night, I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile
                Book. It was almost ten o’clock when we heard the sound of
                wheels. All three of us got up and my mother sent me off to bed
                before my stepfather came in. I kissed her and went quickly to
                my room.

                I was worried about going down to breakfast the following
                morning, as I had not seen Mr. Murdstone since the day I left
                for school. After two or three stops along the way I presented
                myself in the parlour. Mr. Murdstone was standing with his back
                to the fire and Miss Murdstone was making the tea.

                He did not show any sign of recognition so I went to him and
                said, “I beg your pardon, sir. I am very sorry for what I did. I

                said.

                I told her the holidays were a month long. Miss Murdstone was
                very unhappy at this news. She kept a calendar of the holidays
                and every morning checked a day off. When she got to ten days,
                she seemed much happier. It was on this day that I took the baby
                from my mother’s lap. I held him very carefully in my arms. Miss
                Murdstone gave such a scream that I nearly dropped it. She was
                very upset that I was holding the baby and tried to take him
                away from me.

                I was very uncomfortable in the house and seemed to upset
                everyone in it except Peggotty. Sometimes, in the evening, I
                would sit with Peggotty in the kitchen where I was comfortable
                and not afraid to be myself. Mr. and Miss Murdstone did not
                approve of this practice.

                I stood still and hung my head. My mother tried to protect me

                I left Salem House the next afternoon. We travelled slowly and
                did not arrive in Yarmouth until ten o’clock the next morning.
                Mr. Barkis and his cart were not there to meet me and I
                travelled home with a stranger.

                I was in Peggotty’s arms before I got to the door of the house.
                She was crying, but controlled it and spoke to me in whispers.
                Miss Murdstone <strong>ignored </strong> me completely when I
                went into the parlour. Mr. Murdstone did not

                On the day of the <strong>funeral</strong> we stood around the

                Then the earth was piled on top of my mother’s coffin. I held
                Peggotty’s hand as she sobbed and we turned away from the grave
                and walked back to the house.

                That night, Peggotty came to my room. She sat on my bed and held
                my hand. “She wasn’t well,” she said. “Not for a long time, not
                since your baby brother was born. I thought at first that she
                would get better, but she became more delicate and frail every

                Peggotty decided to go to Yarmouth for a fortnight and I was
                allowed to go with her. Mr. Barkis collected us in the cart and
                it was a quiet journey for all of us. Mr. Peggotty and Ham were
                waiting for us. I jumped down from the cart and left Peggotty

                With no mother and no Peggotty to look after me I felt
                neglected. I was not ill-treated, beaten or starved, but neither
                was I loved or taken care of. Day after day, week after week,
                month after month I was uncared for and left to cope alone. I
                was seldom allowed to visit Peggotty although she came to see me
                once every week.

                baby in her arms. There were two other children in the room, a
                boy and a girl, aged about three and four. Mrs. Micawber showed

                time,” said Mrs. Micawber, “they must accept the

                stone.” Mr. Micawber’s creditors visited the house at all hours
                of the day and night. They were quite angry and banged on the
                door loudly.

                said, “Master Copperfield, you are no stranger and I feel I can
                tell you about our difficulties. Apart from a bit of cheese,
                there is nothing to eat in the house.”

                I was very uncomfortable with this information and offered Mrs.
                Micawber the two or three shillings that I still had in my
                pocket. Mrs. Micawber kissed me and told me to put the money
                back in my pocket.

                “No, my dear Master Copperfield,” she said. “I cannot take your
                money, but you can do something for me if you don’t mind.” She
                asked me to take some of the valuable items she still had to the
                pawnbroker and borrow money against them. I agreed to help her
                and did so regularly for some time until Mr. Micawber’s
                difficulties came to a <strong>crisis</strong>. He went bankrupt
                and was arrested early one morning.

                On the first Sunday after the arrest, I went to visit Mr.
                Micawber. I ate with him in his little room and stayed for the
                afternoon. I went home and told Mrs. Micawber of my visit.
                Gradually, everything in the Micawber house was sold to help the
                family and eventually Mrs. Micawber decided to move into the
                prison with Mr. Micawber. I rented a little room, close to the
                prison so that I could visit the Micawbers as they were still
                responsible for me.

                “I shall never think of Mr. Micawber’s difficulties without

                have always behaved kindly to us. You have never been a

                that he was leaving London, so I had nowhere to live. Mr.
                Quinion introduced me to Mr. Tipp, who was a married man and had
                a room to let and it was agreed that I should go and live with
                him and his wife.

                give you except advice. My advice is, never do tomorrow what you
                can do today. My other piece of advice, Copperfield, is this:
                Annual <strong>income</strong> – twenty pounds, annual expense –
                nineteen pounds. Result: happiness. Annual income – twenty
                pounds, annual expense – twenty-one pounds. Result: misery.

                The next morning, I saw the whole family off on the coach to
                Plymouth. I decided that I did not want to work at the warehouse
                anymore and planned to run away. I would go to the country and
                tell my story to my aunt, Miss Betsey Trotwood. I don’t know how
                or why I thought of this plan and I did not know where she
                lived, but I wrote to Peggotty and begged for a half-guinea. I
                said that I would repay it and tell her later what it was for.

                Peggotty’s reply, with the half-guinea, arrived quickly. She
                told me that Miss Betsey lived near Dover but she did not know
                the exact address. I decided to leave at the end of the week and
                managed to find a man with a donkey cart who agreed to take me
                by road to the Dover coach office for a few pennies.

                My box never arrived at the coach office. I set out on the road
                to Dover towards my aunt’s house with only three or four half
                pennies in my pocket. My experience with the Micawbers was very
                useful and at the first chance I took off my waistcoat and sold
                it in a little shop for nine pence, even though it was worth
                much more. I wondered if I would also have to sell my jacket and
                arrive in Dover in just a shirt and a pair of trousers.

                I decided to make my way to Salem House School and sleep in the
                <strong>haystack</strong> outside. I shall never forget the
                lonely feeling of lying down without a roof over my head. At
                first light I crept away just as Mr. Creakle’s boys were getting
                up and I began my long, dusty way to Dover. That Sunday I walked
                23 miles, arriving in Rochester hungry and tired. I didn’t want
                to spend the little money I had, so I spent another night under
                the stars. I walked about 20 miles a day, buying bread and
                sleeping rough outside. When my money ran out I went to a shop
                to sell my jacket. A dreadful, dirty old man was standing in a
                <strong>grubby</strong> shop.

                I agreed, as I was anxious to end the argument. He then tried to
                persuade me to exchange my jacket for a fishing rod or a fiddle.
                I told him that I wanted the money. At last he began to pay me,
                a half penny at a time. When I got outside I realised that he
                had paid me four pence less than the agreed price. I spent three
                pence on some food and drink and <strong>limped</strong> along

                me, saying, “Miss Trotwood is my mistress. What do you want with
                her, boy?”
              </p>

                My aunt’s maid walked out of the shop, telling me to follow her.
                We arrived at a neat cottage with a small garden, full of
                flowers. “This is Miss Trotwood’s house,” said the maid. I
                looked down at myself. My shoes were in very bad condition, I
                had no jacket or waistcoat and my hat was
                <strong>crushed</strong> and bent. My shirt and trousers were
                dirty and worn. I felt very nervous as I waited to introduce
                myself to my aunt.

                My aunt came out of the house wearing gardening gloves and
                waving a large knife in one hand. “Go away,” she cried. “Go
                away! No boys here.” I held my hat in my hand. “Please, madam,”
                I began. “Please, aunt.” Miss Trotwood looked up in surprise.

                “I am your nephew,” I stammered. My aunt sat down on the garden
                path in shock. “I am David Copperfield of Blunderstone in
                Suffolk. You came there the night I was born and saw my mother.
                I have been very unhappy since she died. I have been neglected
                and sent out to work. I have only a little education and I have
                run away to you. I was <strong>robbed</strong> and have walked
                the entire way. I haven’t slept in a bed since I began my
                journey.” I stopped talking and burst into tears.

                My aunt got up quickly and took me into her house. She put me on
                her sofa with a shawl under my head and a handkerchief under my
                feet to keep it clean. She then rang the bell and called for
                Janet, the serving girl. “Go upstairs and ask Mr. Dick to come
                downstairs.”

                A grey-haired, pleasant-looking man entered the room. “Mr.

                “Yes, you are right,” agreed my aunt. She called for Janet to
                run me a bath. The bath was a great comfort and while I was
                bathing, my aunt found me a pair of trousers and a shirt
                belonging to Mr. Dick. When I was clean and dressed, I lay down
                on the sofa and fell asleep. When I woke up, I looked around the
                neat room. We sat down to an excellent dinner and all the time I
                was worrying about what my aunt was going to do with me.

                After dinner I told my aunt and Mr. Dick my story. They asked me
                a lot of questions, which I answered as
                <strong>truthfully</strong> as I could. My aunt was very upset
                to hear that my mother had married again and called my
                stepfather a murderer.

                When I finished telling my tale, my aunt turned to Mr. Dick and
                said, “Now, Mr. Dick. I am going to ask you another question.
                Look at this child. What would you do with him now?”

                So I was taken to bed. I noticed that there were no clothes in
                the room and as I said goodnight and climbed into bed, I thought
                that my aunt might think that I would run away again. My room
                was at the top of the house overlooking the sea and as I drifted
                off to sleep, I thought of all the lonely nights I had spent
                under the stars. I prayed that I might never be
                <strong>homeless</strong> again.

                After a while we stopped in front of a very old house. A thin,
                bony face appeared at a small window on the ground floor and
                quickly disappeared again. It belonged to a red-haired boy of

                Doctor Strong’s was an excellent school. It was very different
                from Mr. Creakle’s school as there was order, discipline and
                cleanliness everywhere. Dr. Strong and the other teachers
                expected the boys to be polite at all times and rarely did we

                My aunt came to visit me at Canterbury on several occasions and
                Mr. Dick came every Wednesday, arriving by stagecoach at noon
                and staying over until the next morning. Mr. Dick really enjoyed
                these Wednesdays and he soon became known to every boy in the
                school.

                Uriah reminded me of the invitation to visit his home and I told
                him that I was waiting to be asked. “Oh, if that’s all, Master
                Copperfield,” he said, “and it really isn’t our humbleness that
                stops you from coming, will you come this evening?”

                I said that I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield and if he
                approved then I would go with pleasure. “Have you been studying
                much law lately?” I asked him. “Oh, Master Copperfield,” he
                said. “My reading is hardly to be called study. Anyway, there
                are a lot of Latin words that are too difficult for a humble man
                to understand.”

                “Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,” he answered, shaking his
                head. “It’s very kind of you to make the offer, but I am much
                too humble to accept it.”

                I told him that he was wrong and that I could help him. “Here is
                my humble home, Master Copperfield,” he said. We entered a low,
                old-fashioned room straight from the street. Mrs. Heap looked
                exactly like Uriah, only shorter.

                “This is a day to be remembered Uriah,” she said to her son.
                “Master Copperfield has been kind enough to pay us a visit. My
                Uriah has looked forward to this visit. He was worried that our
                humbleness would stop you. Humble we are, humble we have been
                and humble we shall ever be.”

                “I am sure you have no reason to be so, madam,” I replied. I was
                embarrassed by these compliments. I ate well and afterwards we
                talked about aunts. I told them about mine and about my father
                and mother. I wanted the visit to be over, but suddenly, a
                figure walked along the street, passed the open door, came back,
                walked in, and shouted loudly, “Copperfield! Is it possible?”

                It was Mr. Micawber! We shook hands and I asked after Mrs.
                Micawber and the children. Mr. Micawber said that she was well
                and would be <strong>delighted</strong> to see me. I told him
                that I would be happy to see her too. I had no choice but to
                introduce Mr. Micawber to Uriah and his mother, after which I
                <strong>hustled</strong> Mr. Micawber out of the door.

                Mrs. Micawber was surprised to see me and we greeted each other
                warmly. I stayed a little while and left after accepting an
                invitation to dinner with them the following evening.

                The next day I was looking out of my window and saw, to my
                surprise, Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walking past, arm in arm.
                That night during dinner, Mr. Micawber turned to me and said, “I
                have to tell you, young Copperfield, your friend Heep is a
                talented man and will go far in this world!”

                I was surprised at this relationship between Micawber and Heep.
                I had a very pleasant dinner with the Micawbers. Afterwards,
                Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch. After the punch we
                were all very merry and sang “Auld Lang Syne” and I left the
                Micawbers feeling very happy.

                Because of this, I was totally unprepared at seven o’clock the
                next morning to receive a desperate letter from Mr. Micawber,
                dated half past nine at night, just a few minutes after I had
                left him.

                Time passed and my school days came to an end. I was sorry to
                leave, as I had a good relationship with Dr. Strong and I
                enjoyed my time at school. I had discussed my future with my
                aunt for the past year or so but did not know what I wanted to

                One morning during the Christmas season my aunt said to me,
                “Trot, my dear, a change of <strong>scenery</strong> will do you
                good. It might help you make up your mind about what you are
                going to do with your life. Why don’t you go down to Yarmouth
                and visit Peggotty?”

                before travelling to Yarmouth. She said that I could stay away
                as long as I liked so long as I wrote to her three times a week
                to let her know that I was well. I agreed to this condition

                I went to say goodbye to Agnes and Mr. Wickfield. Agnes was
                delighted to see me, but after the hugging and greetings were
                done she said, “Trotwood, there is something I would like to ask
                you. You know my father as well; do you think he has changed in
                any way?”

                I had noticed some changes in him and Agnes asked me to explain,
                “His hand trembles, his speech is <strong>slurred</strong> and
                his eyes look wild. His drinking habit has become worse and he
                is unable to work. This makes him so worried that the next day
                he begins drinking again,” I said. “He does not seem to be able
                to snap out of it.”

                “I’m very happy to see you too!” said Steerforth. We sat down
                and told each other what we had been up to since I had left

                Steerforth was now studying at Oxford University and was on his
                way to visit his mother. On learning that I had no definite
                plans, he invited me to spend a few days with him. I agreed
                happily and wrote a letter to my aunt, explaining that I was
                going to spend a few days with Steerforth before visiting
                Peggotty in Yarmouth.

                The next morning Steerforth met me at my hotel and
                <strong>bundled</strong> me into a stagecoach. We drove to an
                old brick house on the top of a hill at Highgate. As we climbed
                down from the stagecoach, an attractive lady walked towards us.
                “My dearest James,” she said, hugging Steerforth. I was
                introduced to Mrs. Steerforth and she welcomed me with open
                arms.

                There was a second lady in the dining room, Miss Rosa Dartle,
                who was Mrs. Steerforth’s companion. This lady was about thirty
                years old, very thin with black hair and black eyes. I stayed
                with Steerforth for a week. Steerforth gave me lessons in
                riding, fencing and boxing, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.
                At the end of the week we said goodbye to Mrs. Steerforth and
                Miss Dartle and took the train to Yarmouth.

                Steerforth said he would follow a little later. She was in the
                kitchen cooking dinner when I arrived. She opened the door as
                soon as I knocked and asked me politely what I wanted. “Is Mr.

                around me, tears running down her face. “Barkis will be so glad
                to see you,” she cried, wiping her tears on her apron. “Your
                visit will do him more good than any medicine.”

                me. Not long after which he knocked on the door. Steerforth and
                I ate dinner with Peggotty and afterwards Steerforth got up to
                leave.

                I spent the night at Peggotty’s and the following evening we set
                out for Mr. Peggotty’s boathouse. I was anxious to show
                Steerforth the house that I had talked so much about.

                “Dismal enough in the dark,” he replied, “and the sea roars as
                if it were hungry for us. Is that the boat I can see up in

                I agreed that it was. We spoke no more until I had my hand on
                the latch of the door. I whispered to Steerforth to keep close
                behind me as I pushed the door open. We entered quietly and
                there they all were! Mr. Peggotty was laughing happily and
                holding Emily in his arms. Ham I stood looking proud and holding
                Emily’s hand. Emily stood laughing prettily, blushing and
                smiling. She was <strong>squeezing</strong> Ham’s hand when I

                Steerforth and I congratulated the happy couple warmly and spent
                a very pleasant evening <strong>chatting</strong> about old
                times and the young couple’s future. It was almost midnight when
                we left. “Emily is a very beautiful girl,” said Steerforth as we

                Steerforth and I stayed in Yarmouth for more than a fortnight.
                We spent time together as well as time apart. Steerforth often
                went sailing with Mr. Peggotty whilst I remained
                <strong>ashore</strong>. There were three or four days when we
                parted after an early breakfast and met up later for dinner. I
                do not know what he did on those days although I did find out
                that he was very popular with everyone in the area.

                One evening I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty’s house sitting in
                front of the fire. He jumped up when I put my hand on his
                shoulder and said angrily, “You frightened me. I didn’t hear you
                come in,” I apologised and was relieved to see him smile and
                hear him say, “So, we leave this carefree life tomorrow?”

                I agreed that we will, and that I had already booked our places
                on the coach. Steerforth looked unhappy and I remarked on it.

                I was stunned at this news and <strong>exclaimed</strong>, “You
                are very strange, Steerforth! You pretend to have bought it for
                yourself, but you may never come near the place again. You

                Steerforth ignored this remark and carried on, “There is a lot
                of work to be done on the boat, so I am leaving Littimer behind
                to oversee it. Did I tell you that he came down from Highgate
                this morning?” Littimer was Steerforth’s servant. He was a quiet
                man, always polite but somehow <strong>secretive</strong>. I did
                not like or trust him.

                “The boat is called ‘Stormy Petrol’ now but I am going to rename
                her,” said Steerforth. “Oh, what are you going to call her?” I
                asked.

                “The Little Emily,” replied Steerforth. “Oh, but look, here
                comes the real Emily, and Ham is with her. He is always with
                her. What is he frightened of? Does he think she will run away?”

                Ham was very <strong>protective</strong> of the pretty Emily and
                put his arm around her as they got closer to us. She shook hands
                with both Steerforth and myself and then after a few words they
                walked on together.

                At breakfast, I received a letter from my aunt and decided to
                discuss it with Steerforth on the coach. We said our goodbyes to
                Mr. and Mrs. Barkis and to Mr. Peggotty, Ham and Emily. Littimer
                was staying behind until the work on the boat was finished.

                On the coach, Steerforth was quieter than usual, but then turned
                to me and asked, “What about that letter you were speaking about
                at breakfast, David?”

                “Oh,” I said, taking it out of my pocket, “It’s from my aunt.
                She reminds me that I came on this trip to think about my future
                and to decide on a career. To tell you the truth, I forgot all
                about it.”

                “Yes, she does. She asks me if I want to be a proctor. What is a
                proctor, Steerforth?” “A proctor is a sort of lawyer,” replied
                Steerforth.

                “But advocates and proctors are not one and the same, are they?”
                I asked, puzzled. “No,” replied Steerforth. “Advocates are men
                who have taken a doctor’s degree at college. Proctors employ
                advocates and they both are paid very well. I would recommend
                you take your aunt’s advice.”

                I made up my mind to do so and decided to travel to town where
                my aunt was waiting for me. My aunt and I
                <strong>embraced</strong> as if we had been apart for many
                years. After supper, my aunt and I sat down to talk. “Well,
                Trot,” she began. “What do you think about the proctor plan or
                not?” haven’t you had time to make up your mind yet?”

                My room was at the top of the house. I was well-looked after by
                Mrs. Crupp, the landlady, and after few days and nights I felt
                as if I had lived there for a year. Steerforth had not turned up
                as we had arranged, so I walked to Highgate and saw Mrs.
                Steerforth. She told me that her son had gone away with one of
                his Oxford friends and was due to return the following day.

                A few days later, I was having my coffee and roll in the morning
                before going to the office, when Steerforth walked in.
                “Steerforth,” I cried. “I was beginning to think I would never
                see you again!” We agreed that he and two friends would join me

                They arrived promptly at six o’clock and I asked Steerforth to
                be in charge over the table, as I was inexperienced in such
                matters. Mrs. Crupp had hired a young man to serve the meal.
                After dinner, we went to the theatre. Due to the large amount of
                wine I had drunk I behaved badly, especially when I saw Agnes. I
                called to her during the <strong>performance</strong> and was
                told to be quiet by everyone around me. Agnes was very
                embarrassed and asked my friends to take me home.

                I awoke with a very bad headache and a feeling of
                <strong>shame</strong> and sadness. As I was leaving for work in
                this sad state, I received a note from Agnes asking me to go and
                see her. I went at once and apologized for my behaviour the
                night before. “It’s over, Trotwood,” she said. “Forget about it.

                and said that Uriah had made himself
                <strong>indispensable</strong>. Agnes then said that she thought
                her father was afraid of Uriah Heep. “Uriah professes humility
                and gratitude, but his position is one of power. He said that he
                was going away because he had found a job with better

                The weeks passed and my training was complete. I was then
                articled at Spenlow and Jorkins at a salary of ninety pounds a
                year. I looked forward to my future as a lawyer. Mr. Spenlow
                invited me to spend a weekend at his house in Norwood with him
                and his daughter. She had just finished her education in Paris

                she and her brother had treated me, but I turned to her and
                said, “Miss Murdstone, you and Mr. Murdstone were cruel to me.
                You treated my mother very unkindly and I will never forgive you

                that Mr. Barkis was ill, as I liked him very much.

                As I was undressing for bed, a letter from Mr. Micawber
                <strong>tumbled</strong> to the floor. It was dated an hour and
                a half before dinner. Mr. Micawber was once again in crisis and
                behind with the rent. I did not feel sorry for Mr. Micawber, but
                I did feel sorry for Traddles, as Mr. Micawber had sold
                Traddles’ possessions as well as his own to
                <strong>pay off</strong> his debts. This would put back my
                friend’s wedding. I wondered if the curate’s daughter would wait
                forever.

                I arrived in Yarmouth in the evening and went to the inn, and
                then went to visit Mr. Peggotty. He opened the door at the first
                step and we shook hands with and thanked him for coming. Emily
                was sitting by the fire with her hands in front of her face and
                Ham was standing next to her.

                “Emily, my dear, here’s Master Davy!” cried Mr. Peggotty. Emily
                trembled and I remember the coldness of her hand when I touched
                it. Peggotty came alone and hugged me and thanked me for coming.
                She led me upstairs to see her husband.

                “Barkis, my dear!” she said, bending over him. “Here’s my dear
                boy Master Davy, who brought us together, Barkis! Won’t you
                speak to Master Davy?” Peggotty spoke to him again and he opened
                his eyes. He tried to stretch out his arm and said to me with a
                pleasant smile, “Barkis is willing.” Then he died.

                I stayed with Peggotty until the funeral was over. She decided
                to return to London with me so that I could execute Mr. Barkis’s
                will. We looked for the will in the box he kept under the bed,
                but after quite a long search it was found at the bottom of the
                horse’s nosebags together with an old gold watch with chain and
                seals, eighty-seven guineas and a half in guineas and
                half-guineas, two hundred and ten pounds in bank notes, receipts
                for Bank of England stock and an old horseshoe. Altogether, Mr.
                Barkis had been worth over three thousand pounds. He left some
                money to Mr. Peggotty, to Ham, to little Emily and to myself,
                but most of it went to his widow.

                The night before Peggotty and I left for London, Ham arrived wet
                and <strong>dripping</strong> on the doorstep. In answer to Mr.
                Peggotty’s question of Emily’s whereabouts, Ham made a motion
                with his head, as if she were outside. Ham asked to speak to me
                outside. He looked pale and I asked him what the matter was.

                I saw the door move. It was too late. I shall never forget the
                look on Mr. Peggotty’s face when he saw us. We all stood in the

                I started reading it slowly. “When you — who love me so much

                leaving my home, never to return unless he marries me and brings

                stood still long after I finished reading. Then he said in a

                Later that day Mr. Spenlow told me that it was Dora’s birthday

                When I arrived for the celebration, Dora was sitting in the
                garden looking beautiful in a white bonnet and a blue dress. A
                young lady called Julia Mills was also there, playing with
                Dora’s dog, Jip. Dora thanked me for the flowers and held them
                up for Jip to smell.

                her brother’s wedding and will be away at least three weeks.

                to the top of a hill, where more friends were waiting for us. We
                had a wonderful time and after lunch Dora and I walked among the
                shady trees holding hands. No words can describe the feelings I
                had that day.

                As we were leaving, Miss Mills explained that Dora was going to
                stay with her for a few days and that she would be happy if I
                visited them.

                The next three days were torture for me, trying to imagine what
                Dora would say to my marriage proposal. I arrived outside Miss
                Mills’ house and walked up and down the street, too nervous to
                knock at the door. When I at last managed to approach the front
                door, I was quickly let in and shown to an upstairs room where
                Miss Mills was copying music and Dora was painting flowers.

                loved her and that I should die without her. I told her that I
                idolized and worshipped her and each time I spoke, Jip barked
                loudly. Dora hung her head and cried but very soon we were
                sitting side by side on the sofa. Dora and I were engaged! It

                We decided to keep our love a secret from Mr. Spenlow for the

                in keeping a secret from my fiancée’s father. I measured Dora’s

                My aunt went on to say that she was mined financially. “All I
                have "In the world is in this room, except for the cottage which
                I have rented out to holidaymakers. Mrs. Barkis, could you help

                My aunt hugged me and kissed me and said, "We must be brave,
                Trot. We must face our problems with courage." That night I gave
                my aunt my bed and I slept in the sitting room. Before bed, we
                talked about my love for Dora and our secret engagement.

                The next morning, I was at the office bright and early waiting
                for Mr. Spenlow to appear with the key. "How are you,
                Copperfield?" he asked. "It's a lovely morning! What are you

                He invited me to his room and I told him about my aunt's loss of
                money. I asked him to return the thousand pounds given for my
                training, so that I could give the money to my aunt. Mr. Spenlow
                said that if it were up to him that it would be done
                immediately, but that his partner, Mr. Jorkins, would never
                agree to it. I asked for permission to speak to Mr. Jorkins
                myself, which Mr. Spenlow <strong>granted</strong>. I went to
                see Mr. Jorkins and told him the story. "I am sorry, Mr.
                Copperfield but I cannot return your money," said Mr. Jorkins
                and then he hurriedly left the office for an appointment at the
                bank.

                Knowing that I could not return my aunt’s money to her depressed
                me and I walked home. My depression lifted when I found Agnes
                waiting for me. We hugged and she told me that she had come to
                London to see my aunt. They were very fond of each other, even
                though there was a great difference in their ages.

                I could not believe my ears when Agnes explained that Uriah Heep
                was now her father’s partner. “My father and Uriah have some
                business here, so I came with them. I do not like my father
                spending too much time alone with Uriah.”

                “Even more,” agreed Agnes sadly. “Uriah and his mother live with
                us now. He sleeps in your old room.” I was very upset by this
                news but didn’t know what I could do to help. We joined my aunt
                and I told them what I had tried to do that morning.

                “That was a silly thing to do,” said my aunt, “but you meant
                well. You are a kind boy and I am proud of you.”

                We discussed my aunt’s unwise investments and how she came to
                lose all of her money. Agnes thought that I might learn more
                about the matter if I became secretary to Dr. Strong. “Doctor
                Strong is <strong>retiring</strong> and has come to live in
                London,” said Agnes, “and he has asked my father to recommend
                someone who could work as a secretary. Don’t you think he would
                rather have his favourite old pupil near him, rather than a
                complete stranger?”

                It was an excellent suggestion and I
                <strong>contacted</strong> Dr. Strong immediately. He was very
                happy to see me and we agreed that I would work for him for two
                hours every morning and two hours every evening except for
                Saturdays and Sundays and that he would pay me seventy pounds a
                year.

                I was very busy, getting up at five in the morning and not
                returning home until nine or ten at night. I did not tell Dora
                any of this in the letters I sent to her in secret. I did not
                want her to worry about me.

                My aunt and I went to visit Mr. Wickfield at his office. Uriah
                Heep was <strong>hovering</strong> nearby. I had not seen Mr.
                Wickfield for a long time and I was shocked by his appearance.
                He looked much older, his eyes were bloodshot and his hands were
                trembling. His good looks had gone and he walked and spoke like
                an old man. Uriah Heep seemed to hold a great power over Mr.
                Wickfield although I did not know why.

                Agnes softly spoke to her father, "Father, Miss Trotwood and

                because I couldn’t trust it to you, as you have invested my
                money <strong>unwisely</strong>. In my opinion, Agnes is worth
                more than the whole firm and she should run this business for

                with Miss Trotwood and should be only too happy if Miss Agnes
                was a partner in this firm.” He turned to me, “Mister
                Copperfield, I hope I see you well. I am happy to see you, even
                under these <strong>circumstances</strong>.” He shook hands with
                me and said: “How do you think we are looking, Master
                Copperfield—I should say, Mister! Don’t you find Mr. Wickfield
                in good health, sir?”

                appointment and those of us remaining sat and talked of
                pleasanter things. Without Uriah Heep watching him, Mr.
                Wickfield became more like his former self and agreed that it
                was just like old times.

                My new life with my aunt had lasted for more than a week when
                Peggotty returned to Yarmouth to look after Ham. I received an
                invitation from Miss Mills to join her and Dora for tea the
                following Saturday.

                Dora did not believe me until she saw my serious face. Then she
                began to cry. I fell on my knees and begged her not to cry. When
                the sobbing had stopped, I told her that I really was a poor man
                and explained how it had happened. I told her I was not afraid
                of hard work, and how I was also working for Doctor Strong. I
                said that I hoped she would not mind being married to a poor man
                and that I would work very hard to make her happy. I drew a
                sketch of the little cottage I had seen at Highgate, where I
                wanted us to live after we were married.

                I explained my aunt’s situation but Dora did not seem very happy
                about my aunt living with us in our little cottage. She was also
                unhappy when I suggested that she learn how to cook and keep
                accounts. I was relieved when Julia Mills walked into the room
                and we could stop talking about our future.

                One day, when I went to the office, I found Mr. Spenlow in the
                doorway looking very serious. He did not answer my greeting and
                coldly requested me to go with him to a coffeehouse down the
                street. I was surprised to see Miss Murdstone there holding in
                her hand a bundle of my love letters to Dora. Our secret had
                been discovered!

                daughter, Mr. Copperfield! I don’t believe you. It’s some sort

                engagements. “Let there be an end to this nonsense,” he said.

                I went home and told my aunt everything and went to bed in

                The room began to spin and I thought I was going to faint. One
                of the clerks sat me down in a chair and brought me some water
                and loosened my tie. I asked what had happened and how Mr.

                “Mr. Spenlow had dinner out yesterday,” said the clerk, “but his
                horse and carriage arrived home without him. He had been driving
                himself, as he does sometimes. The servants went to look for him

                The clerk went on to tell me that Mr. Spenlow was badly in debt
                and that once all his debts had been paid there would only be a
                thousand pounds left for his daughter. I was very worried about
                Dora, who was now an orphan. I received a letter from Julia
                Mills telling me that Dora was going to stay with her two aunts
                in Putney. This made me feel better, knowing that Dora was not
                on her own.

                At my aunt’s suggestion, I took a little holiday in Dover and

                fine with the cottage and on my way back to London I stopped at
                Canterbury to see Agnes. I found Mr. Micawber sitting where
                Uriah Heep used to sit. He seemed very happy to see me, but
                appeared a little confused as well. He told me that he and Mrs.
                Micawber were staying at Uriah Heep’s old house and that his

                I was very disturbed by this news and stopped by Agnes’s room
                where she was writing at her desk. I told her that I had missed
                her and then went on to tell her everything that had happened
                between Mr. Spenlow and myself and of his sudden death. Agnes

                I went downstairs to visit Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep. Mr.
                Wickfield’s room looked shabby and dusty while Uriah Heep’s
                office looked newly painted and fresh. They greeted me both in
                their own way. Mr. Wickfield looked at me with pleasure and
                said, “Please stay with us Trotwood, while you are in

                I asked if there was room for me and Uriah said that they would
                be happy to have me there. He said that I could sleep in my old
                room but I offered to sleep in another room, not wanting to
                upset the domestic arrangements of the house.

                All the time I stayed with the Wickfields, Uriah Heep did not
                leave me alone with Agnes and Mr. Wickfield for one minute. If
                he left the room, then his mother was there. By the second
                evening, I was so fed up with their company that I went for a
                walk by myself. I had not walked far when Uriah shambled up
                behind me. I stopped to speak to him. “How fast you walk,” he
                exclaimed. “My legs are very long, but I’ve had a job to keep up
                with you.

                England where he found that not only had Emily written to him

                Just a few days after seeing Mr. Peggotty, I received a letter
                from Dora’s aunts inviting me to visit. I was so nervous that I
                took Traddles with me. We presented ourselves at the appointed
                time and were shown into the drawing room where I found two
                little ladies, dressed in black.

                They asked me to sit down which I did after I had introduced
                Traddles. I was nervous and uncomfortable under the stares of
                Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa Spenlow. “You ask permission of
                my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield, to visit our
                niece,” stated Miss Lavinia.

                I nodded and stammered my agreement. Miss Lavinia continued,
                “Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been careful
                indeed in considering this. No doubt you think you like her very
                much.”

                I was about to interrupt the lady but stopped as soon as
                Traddles spoke up on my behalf, telling the ladies about his own

                shall be happy to sit down to tea with Mr. Copperfield. We eat

                my dear, sweet Dora. She looked beautiful in a black dress and
                sobbed and cried her joy at seeing me standing there. After a

                difficult, so Miss Lavinia gave me permission to visit every
                Saturday afternoon as well, which made my life much easier. I
                was pleased that Dora's aunts and my own aunt visited each other

                Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa gave their consent and I was
                going to be married to Dora! The wedding preparations were
                complete and I bought the marriage license. I greeted the
                arriving guests and it was a great pleasure to meet Traddles'
                fiancée, Sophy. She was a lovely girl and Traddles presented her
                with great pride to Dora’s aunts. Many friends arrived for the
                occasion, Agnes and Peggotty among them. Mr. Dick was to give
                Dora away at the altar.

                I can’t remember what I said during my speech at the wedding

                going-away outfit and being ready to begin our new life
                together. There were many tears, hugs and kisses, goodbyes and

                I don’t think any young couple knew less about keeping house
                than my lovely wife and myself. We had servants, but they seemed
                to know less than we did. Dora could neither cook nor manage the
                house, nor command and control the servants. We muddled along
                quite happily for a while until I became so tired of badly
                cooked meals that I asked my aunt to teach Dora to cook.

                My aunt refused, crying, “Trot, don’t ask me to do that. You

                Not long after the wedding I invited Traddles to dinner. It was
                then that I realised how little space there seemed to be in our
                cottage. My wife sat prettily at one end of the table and
                everything around her seemed in a jumble. Poor Traddles was so
                jammed with Dora’s flower painting and my writing table that it
                was impossible for him to use a knife and fork. “Plenty of room,
                Copperfield,” cries Traddles when I tried to apologise. “Don’t
                worry about it! I’m fine!”
              </p>

                The meal itself was a disaster. The oysters weren’t open and we
                had no oyster knife to open them. The mutton was
                <strong>raw</strong>, but Traddles ate it anyway. After Traddles
                left, Dora apologised for the disastrous meal and promised to do
                better in future. She said that she was going to be a wonderful
                housekeeper but somehow the household figures would just not add
                up. When I was writing at night, Dora would sit bent over her
                accounts but her sighing disturbed me so that I could not put
                pen to paper. “What’s the matter, Dora?” I asked.

                My wife would look up hopelessly and reply, “They won’t come
                right. They give me a headache and they won’t do anything I
                want!” I would give her a practical demonstration but Dora’s
                attention would wander after just five minutes and I would put
                my pencil down.

                I had been married for about a year when I passed Mrs.
                Steerforth’s house on my way home. A servant came out of the
                house and told me that Miss Dartle would like to speak to me and
                that she was waiting for me in the garden. Our meeting was not a
                happy one and Miss Dartle spoke to me angrily. “Has that girl

                “Yes, from him,” she laughed cruelly. “If she is not found soon,
                she may never be found. She may be dead! Do you want to know

                I answered that I did. She called for Mr. Littimer to join us
                and instructed him to tell me everything that had happened since
                Emily left Yarmouth.

                Mr. Littimer began quietly, “Mr. James and myself have been
                abroad with the young woman ever since she left Yarmouth. We
                have travelled <strong>extensively</strong>. We have been in
                France, Switzerland, Italy, all over the place. Mr. James was
                very fond of the young woman and helped her improve herself in
                her manners, dress and language. The young lady was admired
                wherever she went. Unfortunately, she became restless and
                depressed and Mr. James became very impatient with her. Finally,
                one morning, he left for Naples and told me to tell the young
                woman that he had gone. He said that she should marry a
                respectable person and settle down.”

                Littimer <strong>paused</strong> and could not look me in the
                eye. “It was necessary to restrain her because she took Mr.
                James’ departure very badly and I was worried that she might
                harm herself. Later that night, she climbed out of a small
                window and ran away.”

                “It’s very possible that she may have drowned herself,”
                continued Littimer. “Or maybe the boatmen she used to talk to on
                the beach helped her escape.”

                Time passed and my Dora became unwell. She was always tired and

                The following morning, he came to see me and told me Emily had

                out and died.

                after all the heartache and sorrow. There was nothing left for
                me in England. Before my ship sailed I decided to go to Yarmouth

                We struggled nearer and nearer to the sea and the wind blew with

                had been able to get through such
                <strong>treacherous</strong> weather and that we had survived

                I watched the crowd and to my surprise saw Ham amongst the
                villagers. I watched as he tied a rope around his waist, and I
                realised he was going into the cruel sea. I ran to him and
                begged him not to risk his life but he shook me off and waded
                into the waves.

                I watched as his body was dashed against the wreckage and as I
                stood mesmerized, the shipwreck sank
                <strong>beneath</strong> the waves and Ham was being carried,
                unconscious, to the shore. Not just unconscious, but dead. I
                would never look into Ham’s smiling face again. I wept then for
                Ham, for myself and for Emily.

                I was in for another shock; not only was Ham dead, but
                Steerforth as well. Steerforth had been on the ship and had
                perished at sea. His body was carried to the inn and I knew that
                I would have to break the news of his death to Mrs. Steerforth.

                I travelled to Highgate but was told that Mrs. Steerforth was an
                invalid. She could not come down the stairs to meet with me, and
                so I was shown to her bedroom. She was not alone. Rosa Dartle
                was also there, looking at me suspiciously. I trembled as I
                tried to speak. Mrs. Steerforth looked at me and asked, “My son
                is ill?” I could only nod my agreement.
              </p>

                I then explained, as best I could, all that had happened that
                fateful morning. Mrs. Steerforth moaned in pain as she fell back
                in her chair.

                My next painful duty was to <strong>conceal</strong> Ham’s death
                from Mr. Peggotty and Emily so that they left for Australia
                happy in their ignorance. I went in search of Mr. Micawber to
                ask him for his help in keeping this tragic news from the
                Peggotts. Mr. Micawber told me that they were sailing earlier
                than expected—the next day.

                The following day, Peggotty and I went to Gravesend and found
                the ship on the river. Martha told me that she, too, was
                travelling to Australia with Mr. Peggotty and Emily. I turned to
                Mr. Peggotty with love in my heart, “Good luck, you are a good
                man!” I embraced Mr. Peggotty, Emily, Martha and the Micawbers
                and watched the ship sail away, filled with people on their way
                to a new beginning.

                It was not long after that when I left England. I travelled from
                country to country through Switzerland and over the Alps into
                Italy. In my <strong>solitude</strong> I
                <strong>mourned</strong> my wife and cried for her death. I had
                not really kept in touch with those in England, just a few lines
                here and there from different cities. On arriving in different
                countries I found letters that had been forwarded to me.

                I opened and read one from Agnes. I was surprised to find that
                thoughts of Agnes were filling my head and my heart more and
                more often. I read her letter many times and wrote to her before
                I slept that night.

                I continued my travelling and picked up my pen once more and
                began to write. I worked from early in the morning until late at
                night and finally finished a story. I sent it to Traddles and he
                arranged for its publication. With this success I set to work in
                earnest. Not only was I writing well, I was taking exercise,
                feeling fit and healthy.

                Agnes and I wrote regularly and I came to realise that I loved
                her, but I also knew that it was too late. Agnes had her own
                life, one that did not include me.

                After three long years abroad, I returned to England, landing in
                London one autumn evening. I immediately went to see Traddles,
                who was now working as a lawyer. He had finally married his
                pretty Sophy. I found him in his chambers and told the clerk
                that I wished to see him. “Goodness!” cried Traddles, “It’s
                Copperfield!” and rushed into my arms. “How wonderful to see
                you! You have grown so famous. When did you arrive, where have
                you come from? What have you been doing?”

                Traddles did not give me time to answer one question before he
                fired off another. He proudly introduced me to the lovely Sophy
                and I was delighted to see how happy they were. I spent a
                pleasant evening with the Traddles before spending my first
                night back in England at a nearby inn.

                The following morning, I took a coach to Dover to visit my aunt,
                I burst into the parlour where my aunt was drinking tea. She and
                Mr. Dick welcomed me with open arms and I was
                <strong>overjoyed</strong> to see dear old Peggotty, who was now

                My aunt and I talked long into the night. She gave me news of
                Mr. Peggotty and Emily and of the Micawbers. They were doing
                well in their new country. Mr. Peggotty had become a
                hard-working and <strong>prosperous</strong> farmer and Mr.
                Micawber was a magistrate. I asked about Mr. Wickfield and

                be. If Agnes wanted to be married she could have done so twenty

                the new maid to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman wanted to
                see her. Agnes came into the room and I caught her in my arms.

                “What should I tell you?” she answered. “My father is well. You
                see us here, quiet in our own home. We have no problems now that
                we have our home back. Knowing that, dear Trotwood, you know

                I looked at her and asked if there was anything else I should
                know. She told me about her school and about her life with her

                return later when Mr. Wickfield was at home.

                I returned to Dover and stayed with my aunt while I finished my
                book. I had been in England for two months and it was around
                Christmas time. I had visited Agnes regularly, but she had said
                nothing of a new friend and my hopes had begun to rise. I
                decided to go and visit her one cold and
                <strong>frosty</strong> morning.

                I was sad and deep in thought as I rode to Canterbury. I found
                Agnes alone by the fire, reading a book. I sat beside her and
                told her that I needed to speak to her privately. She nodded
                encouragingly. “My dear Agnes, do you have a secret? Please let
                me share it” , She trembled as she looked down, away from my
                face. She then jumped up and hurried across the room, bursting
                into tears. “You are wrong, Trotwood,” she cried. “I have no
                secrets from you.”

                “Agnes,” I cried as I went to her side. “I must say what is in
                my heart. You have always been my guide and my support, Agnes,
                When I loved Dora, my love would have been incomplete without

                I held her in my arms. She still wept, but joyfully now. She
                shyly told me that she had loved me her whole life. The next day
                we rode to Dover to tell my aunt the good news. We found her
                sitting by the fire.

                My aunt hugged and kissed us both. She was overjoyed. Peggotty
                hugged and kissed us both, as did Mr. Dick. My aunt said that
                she had always hoped that I would marry Agnes and it was me that
                she had meant when she said that she thought Agnes had a special
                friend. Unfortunately, I had been too <strong>blind</strong> to
                see it.

                and was doing well for himself. Before Mr. Peggotty returned to
