                  Emily Jane Brontë an English novelist and poet, was born in
                  July, 1818 in Thornton, Yorkshire, England. Emily was part of
                  a talented literary family. Her sisters, Charlotte and Anne,
                  also became well-known writers.

                  Emily’s formal education began when she attended the Clergy
                  Daughters’ School at Cowan Bridge, but she was later removed
                  from the school along with her sisters due to poor conditions
                  and the outbreak of tuberculosis. After leaving the school,
                  Emily was primarily educated at home by her father.

                  Emily Brontë’s literary career is primarily centered around
                  “Wuthering Heights” which was published in 1847 under the
                  pseudonym Ellis Bell.

                  The novel is known for its dark, passionate characters and its
                  exploration of themes such as love, revenge, and the
                  supernatural. Despite initial mixed reviews, “Wuthering
                  Heights” gained popularity over time and is now considered one
                  of the greatest novels in the English language.

                  Emily Brontë led a relatively secluded life, spending much of
                  her time with her family at the parsonage in Haworth,
                  Yorkshire. She was known for her love of nature and her
                  solitary nature. Her experiences growing up in the rugged
                  Yorkshire moors greatly influenced her writing, providing the
                  atmospheric backdrop for her novels.

                  Emily Brontë’s literary career was cut short by illness. She
                  died of tuberculosis in December 1848 at the age of 30, just
                  one year after the publication of “Wuthering Heights.”

                  “Wuthering Heights” is a timeless classic of English
                  literature, written by Emily Brontë and published in 1847. Set
                  against the atmospheric backdrop of the Yorkshire moors,
                  Brontë’s only novel is tackled the haunting tale of love,
                  revenge, and the destructive power of passion.

                  At its heart, “Wuthering Heights” explores the tumultuous
                  relationships between the inhabitants of two neighboring
                  households: the Earnshaws of Wuthering Heights and the Lintons
                  of Thrushcross Grange. Through the eyes of the narrator, Mr.
                  Lockwood, and later through the recollections of the
                  housekeeper, Nelly Dean, the reader is drawn into a complex
                  web of family secrets, forbidden love, and vengeful obsession.

                  Central to the novel is the passionate and destructive love
                  between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, an orphaned boy
                  taken in by the Earnshaw family. Their bond defies social
                  conventions and transcends mere affection, but it is also
                  marked by jealousy, manipulation, and cruelty.

                  As the story unfolds, Brontë delves deep into the dark
                  recesses of the human psyche, exploring themes of class
                  conflict, revenge, and the cyclical nature of violence.

                  The novel’s setting plays a crucial role in shaping its mood
                  and atmosphere. The desolate Yorkshire moors mirror the wild
                  and untamed emotions of the characters, while the isolated and
                  windswept landscape serves as a metaphor for their turbulent
                  inner lives.

                  From the imposing presence of the titular Wuthering Heights to

                  society and the characters themselves.

                  In the year 1801, having just returned from visiting my
                  landlord, the only neighbour I choose to be involved with, I
                  find myself in a location far away from society, slightly
                  solitary, yet its innate charm captivates me. This place

                  While crossing the threshold, I came to notice some strange On
                  the main door and among them, two words: “1500” and “Hareton
                  Earnshaw.” This aroused my curiosity to know something of the
                  history of this place from its owner, but his gruff and
                  impatient manner <strong>put me off</strong>.

                  One more step brought us into the family’s sitting room, which
                  they call here the house. It included a kitchen and a parlour,
                  but here, the kitchen seemed shifted inside, as I did not see
                  any sign of roasting, boiling or baking near the huge
                  fireplace.

                  Besides, I could hear the clutter of utensils and feminine
                  voices coming from inside. At the other end of the room,
                  however, I could see rows of dishes, silver jugs and
                  <strong>tankards</strong> stacked up to the roof.

                  The apartment and furniture looked typically like of a
                  northern farmer’s, but the owner stood in complete contrast to
                  them. His appearance was that of a <strong>gypsy</strong>, but
                  he was dressed and had the manners of a gentleman. His look
                  was unhappy, with a hint of ill-bred pride. As we settled in
                  our seats across each other, he ordered Joseph to bring some
                  tea.

                  Probably with a view to being nice to his tenant, he started a

                  As I took his leave, I had made up my mind to pay him another
                  visit the next day. The following afternoon was cold, and I
                  reached the Heights just in time to escape the first flakes of

                  Beside the fire, I was pleased to notice a young miss whose

                  waited for a seat to be offered, but she kept looking fixedly

                  She was fair, with a round and pretty face, and golden locks
                  hanging loosely around her neck. She had beautiful eyes, but

                  too, as those of a labourer, his <strong>bearing</strong> was

                  The business of eating being over, I approached a window to
                  examine the weather. It was sorrowful. The night was
                  descending early, and a cold, bitter wind was blowing. A storm

                  Heathcliff told Zillah to give me a glass of water and then

                  recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a

                  of a chair and an oak case with squares cut near the top
                  resembling windows. In fact, it formed a little closet, and

                  hand had closed upon it. I tried to draw back my arm, but the

                  his hands, and his <strong>agitation</strong> was so extreme
                  that he could hardly pick it up. “It is only your guest, sir,”

                  of work and, drawing her seat near, began — Before I came to
                  live here, I mostly stayed at Wuthering Heights, because my
                  mother raised Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, Hareton’s father, and I
                  used to play with the children. One fine morning, as Mr.
                  Earnshaw, the old master, was about to go to Liverpool, he
                  instructed Joseph about the day’s work. And after kissing
                  goodbye his children, Catherine and Hindley, he set off for
                  the journey.

                  That boy was Heathcliff, and this was Heathcliff’s first
                  introduction to the family. Soon, Cathy and Heathcliff became
                  very friendly, but Hindley hated him. Hindley’s cruelties to
                  him only made Heathcliff dearer to my master. Heathcliff
                  himself was a <strong>sullen, ill-disposed</strong> child, and
                  I could never understand why my master had taken a fancy to
                  him. Heathcliff was not <strong>insolent</strong> to his
                  <strong>benefactor</strong>, but simply insensible and never
                  showed any sign of gratitude. Knowing perfectly what hold he
                  had on Mr. Earnshaw’s heart and conscience, he had only to
                  speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his

                  Over time, Mr. Earnshaw’s health began to fail, and he grew
                  more possessive towards Heathcliff, his object of affection.
                  Any insult to Heathcliff on Hindley’s part drove the old man
                  to fury, with the result that Heathcliff’s pride and black
                  temper grew more vicious. Lastly, our priest, as a solution,
                  suggested that Hindley be sent to college, and Mr. Earnshaw
                  agreed.

                  One October evening, Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair.
                  The house was without a master now. When the news reached
                  Hindley, he arrived for the funeral with a wife, much to the
                  amazement of all.

                  On his return, Hindley settled himself as the master of the
                  house. On the very first occasion, he told Joseph and me that
                  we must move to the back kitchen.

                  He had the air of a man of the world now. His wife expressed
                  pleasure at having Catherine as a sister-in-law, and gave her
                  many presents. But her affections tired very soon, and she
                  became easily annoyed. Hindley, too, grew
                  <strong>tyrannical</strong>.

                  After Mr. Earnshaw’s death, Hindley remembered his father as
                  an <strong>oppressor</strong> and saw Heathcliff as a
                  <strong>usurper</strong> of his parent’s affections and
                  privileges. A few words from his wife indicating her dislike
                  for Heathcliff were sufficient to arouse all his hatred for
                  the boy. He drove him from their company and forced him to
                  work outdoors as hard as any other boy on the farm.

                  Heathcliff bore his <strong>degradation</strong> rather
                  easily, because Catherine told him what she learnt and also
                  played with him in the fields. They both promised to grow up
                  as rude as savages, Hindley being entirely negligent of all
                  this as they kept clear of him.

                  One Sunday evening, Heathcliff and Cathy were banished from
                  the sitting room for making some noise. At supper time, they
                  could not be found anywhere. Their wild uncontrollable manners
                  gave me a clue of the hard times to come. I retired to bed
                  with a heavy heart.

                  On a fine June day, a little baby was born to Mr. Hindley, but
                  the mother died soon after. I was now to nurse the child
                  called Hareton. Mr. Hindley saw the little baby was healthy,
                  and never heard him cry, so he remained contented.

                  Hindley’s treatment of Heathcliff now was enough to make an
                  enemy of even a saint. The house had indeed become infernal.
                  The <strong>curate</strong> stopped calling, and nobody decent
                  came near us except Edgar Linton, son of Mr. Linton of
                  Thrushcross Grange, who had lately been quite impressed with
                  Cathy’s beauty. At fifteen, she was the queen of the
                  countryside, but she was a naughty and headstrong creature.

                  In fact, even I did not like her arrogance. Heathcliff kept
                  his hold on Cathy’s affections, and the young Linton found it
                  difficult to make an equally deep impression on her with all
                  his superiority.
                  <br />
                  Edgar Linton was always received with civility in Wuthering
                  Heights, but his visits had started a struggle inside
                  Catherine. All the gentlemanly ways of Edgar necessitated that
                  Cathy too behaved accordingly, but the rustic and unpolished
                  temperament within her found it difficult to cope with this.

                  Both she and Heathcliff poured <strong>contempt</strong> on
                  him in his absence. But when Edgar showed disgust for and
                  <strong>antipathy</strong> to Heathcliff in some measure, she
                  had to accept it. Edgar’s visits troubled her as she found it
                  difficult to keep a double character. I knew of her
                  <strong>perplexities</strong> but did not say anything until
                  one day she came to me herself.

                  Mr. Hindley was not at home one afternoon, and Heathcliff had

                  “As I said, sir, I went to Thrushcross Grange with Miss
                  Catherine. I was amazed to see that she behaved infinitely
                  better than I had expected. She seemed almost quite fond of
                  Edgar and showed plenty of affection even towards his sister,
                  Isabella. I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of
                  <strong>ruffling</strong> her humour. If anybody fidgeted
                  against her wishes or orders, Mr. Linton immediately showed
                  his displeasure. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence,
                  but everyone behaved so sympathetically that I began to hope
                  that the time of peace and happiness was there to stay now.
                  But, alas, I was wrong.”

                  address the ploughboy. In the light of the candles, he saw
                  that Heathcliff was a tall, athletic man with an air of
                  maturity about him.

                  him as if she feared he would vanish if she took her eyes off

                  ordinary tone and a measure of politeness. Catherine came to

                  The meal was over in ten minutes, and Heathcliff departed in

                  Earnshaw had invited him! I grew

                  thoroughly indifferent to the sentiments of Isabella towards
                  him. At last, he turned and stared hard at her as one might do
                  at a strange, repulsive animal. Isabella could not bear that
                  and grew white and red in rapid succession and, to remove
                  herself from Catherine’s firm grip, dug her nails in her flesh
                  so hard that blood appeared. Exclaiming with pain, Catherine
                  set her free, and Isabella rushed out of the room.

                  After she had gone, Heathcliff turned towards Catherine and
                  asked, “Why were you teasing her in that manner, Cathy? You
                  were not speaking the truth, were you?”

                  “I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been waiting for
                  you for several weeks, and I have been greatly abused this
                  morning as I had tried to lessen her

                  I determined to watch Heathcliff’s movements. I wanted
                  something to happen which would free both Thrushcross Grange
                  and Wuthering Heights, quietly leaving us the peace of earlier
                  days. But Heathcliff’s visits continued as before, and I saw
                  an evil beast in him, waiting for his chance to jump to her.

                  The next time Heathcliff came, Isabella was feeding some
                  pigeons in the court. She and Catherine had not spoken to each
                  other for three days. Heathcliff had not been in the habit of
                  paying attention to Isabella earlier; but today, he stopped
                  and, after cautiously surveying the place, stepped forwards
                  and said something to her.

                Edgar tried to take the key from Catherine’s grasp, but she
                flung it into the fire. Mr. Edgar was taken aback with
                trembling, and his face grew deadly pale. He could not suppress
                his emotions, and anguish and humiliation overcame him
                completely.

                I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton, and the
                servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through
                the house quietly and exchanging whispers as they encountered
                each other during their work. Everyone was active except Miss
                Isabella. The servants began to remark how soundly Isabella
                slept, and her brother, too, asked if she had shown any anxiety
                for her sister-in-law. Then, suddenly, one of the maids came
                panting upstairs and cries “Master, Master, Isabella is gone —
                she is gone; Heathcliff’s ran off with her.”

                “That’s not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising with agitation “Go
                and find her.” I ran and <strong>peeped</strong> into Isabella’s
                room, confirming when I returned, the servant’s
                <strong>statement</strong>. Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by
                the bed and, on my coming back, read the meaning of my
                <strong>blank</strong> aspect and dropped his eyes without
                giving an order or uttering a word.

                For two months, the <strong>fugitives</strong> remained absent.
                In those months, Catherine, who had brain fever, lay between
                life and death. No mother could have nursed a child more
                <strong>devotedly</strong> than Edgar tended her. Day and night
                he sat there, watching and tending her, caring nothing for his
                own health. At last, when the doctor announced her life was out
                of danger, it was as if Edgar was recovering a new life.

                due in a short time.

                Some six weeks after the flight, Isabella sent a short note to
                her brother announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. At the
                bottom was an <strong>obscure</strong> apology and a request for
                <strong>reconciliation</strong>, but Edgar did not reply to
                this. Two weeks later, I received a long letter from her which
                made me sadly aware of the misery she was in.

                As I had feared, she had been receiving abuse and ill-treatment
                at the hands of Heathcliff from the moment she stepped into
                Wuthering Heights. She pleaded with me to ask her brother’s
                forgiveness and come to her at the earliest opportunity

                The poor creature understood now that she had become a pawn in
                Heathcliff’s game of revenge. I informed Mr. Linton of the state
                of affairs, but he did nothing. However, he allowed me to visit
                Wuthering Heights.

                Mr. Edgar’s refusal to be reconciled with his sister had

                When I reached the Heights, I saw her looking through the

                listless, and her dress was dirty and <strong>crumpled</strong>.
                She came forwards eagerly to greet me and held out her hand for
                the expected letter.

                I shook my head, and her lip quivered slightly, and that was
                all. Upon his enquiry, I told Heathcliff about Cathy’s illness
                and asked him to stay away from the Grange if he really cared
                for her to recover.

                But Heathcliff was <strong>adamant</strong> and kept pressing me
                for an interview with her, threatening he would manage it
                himself if I did not cooperate. I tried to dissuade him, saying
                that meeting her now was only going to increase her distress. In
                the end, seeing no other way, I agreed to carry a letter from
                him to Catherine.

                It was only on the fourth day that I could bring that letter to

                to read it herself, as she did not know from whom it came.

                troubled <strong>gleam</strong> of

                letter, but again let it fall and gazed at me with questioning

                Heathcliff, meanwhile, had begun to doubt my promise as four
                days had passed without any information, and so he came to the

                The next twelve years were the happiest of my life. I was the
                nurse and mother to baby Catherine, and except for
                <strong>trifling</strong> illnesses, she had a wonderful
                <strong>constitution</strong>. She grew into a real beauty. She
                had inherited Mr. Earnshaw’s handsome dark eyes and Mr. Linton’s
                fair skin and small features. Her spirit was high, her anger was
                never furious and her love, never fierce. Edgar took on her
                education entirely himself, as he was pleased to find that she
                had curiosity and a quick intellect. She learnt rapidly and
                eagerly, and this made her an <strong>apt</strong> scholar.

                out sometimes to a mile or so, but he trusted her to no one
                else. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for
                her.

                not until she had grown up.

                One day, Mr. Edgar received a letter from his sister Isabella.
                She was on her deathbed and had <strong>entreated</strong> her
                brother to forgive her and come so she could place her son
                Linton in his hands safely and die in peace.

                Catherine did not see her cousin again for a long time, and
                before she did, his features had become so dim in her memory
                that she could not recognise him. However, I used to ask the
                housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, whenever I chanced to
                encounter him, how Linton was getting on.

                I was told he continued to be in weak health. Heathcliff

                There was hardly any talk between them. Linton himself was
                selfish and disagreeable, and his continuous sulking annoyed
                everyone in the house. My interest in him consequently
                <strong>decayed</strong>, though I was moved with a sense of
                grief at his condition and a wish that he had been left with us.

                This 20<sup>th</sup> of March was a beautiful spring day. My
                young lady came down, dressed for going out, and asked me to
                accompany her. Mr. Linton had given permission if we went only a
                short distance and were back within an hour.

                I put on my bonnet and came out. Cathy bounded before me like a
                young greyhound, her golden locks flying in the air and her eyes
                <strong>radiant</strong> with happiness.

                “Oh, a little further — only a little,” was her reply,
                continually. At length, I began to feel tired. Before long, she
                had come close to Wuthering Heights. I saw some people
                surrounding her, one of whom, I felt sure, looked like Mr.

                “Yes,” Heathcliff replied, “your mother’s nephew. Don’t you like

                After some time had passed, Linton started showing signs of
                uneasiness, perhaps
                <strong>repenting</strong> that he had denied himself the treat

                Linton gathered his energies and left the hearth. As he stepped
                out, I heard Cathy ask Hareton “What was the inscription over

                reaching over to gather some buds that blossomed scarlet on the

                I pulled away from Cathy to close the door, rolled a stone
                against it to hold it, and then spreading my umbrella, for the
                rain had begun, drew Cathy underneath.

                As we hurried towards home, I felt instinctively that
                Catherine’s heart was now clouded in darkness, for she seemed to
                regard Heathcliff’s words as true.

                In the evening, as she lay on the rug weeping silently, I tried
                to make her understand the falseness of Mr. Heathcliff’s
                <strong>assertions</strong>, but could not
                <strong>counteract</strong> the effect he had produced.

                She said to me “You may be right, Ellen, but I shall never feel
                at ease until I know.” The <strong>premonition</strong> was
                clear to me. Next day, I found myself on the road to Wuthering

                I hoped that Linton himself, by his reception of us, might prove
                how

                However, I was wrong in hoping that. The meeting of the two
                cousins only succeeded in rekindling their old attachment. They
                were more drawn to each other now than ever, as one wanted love
                and sympathy, and the other almost craved to give it.

                Unfortunately, I caught a cold on the next morning of our visit
                and was laid up for three weeks. All these three weeks, my
                little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me

                At the end of the three weeks, I had recovered enough to leave
                my bed and move about the house. On the first evening, as I sat
                in a chair, feeling dull, I asked Catherine to read to me.

                She consented rather unwillingly, I thought. The following
                night, she seemed more impatient, and on the third, she
                complained of a headache and left me.

                Spring advanced, yet my master gathered no real strength, though
                he would walk in the grounds with his daughter. He wrote to
                Linton again, expressing his great desire to see him, but both
                times, he replied saying that his father, Mr. Heathcliff,
                objected to his calling at the Grange. Linton had written:

                Soon, it was June. Though the climate had warmed up, my master’s
                health kept <strong>deteriorating</strong>. Linton’s letters
                came now and then, all with the same wish of an interview with

                However, Mr. Edgar could not consent to it because his health
                did not allow him to accompany her. Linton’s health, also, was
                failing fast, but we had no idea of this as Heathcliff did not

                However, one day, when summer was past, Edgar reluctantly gave

                Catherine was grieved at his sight. The expression of joy on her

      I looked for someone to give me information about her, but nobody seemed at hand. As I <strong> hesitated </strong> whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress, a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay there sucking a sugar-candy, watching me with apathy.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/74/6.mp3">
      “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded. He did not answer.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/74/7.mp3">
      “Is she gone?” I said.

      “You won’t let her, you little idiot,” I exclaimed “Direct me to her room immediately.”

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/74/10.mp3">
      “Papa would hurt you if you attempted to go there,” he answered. “He says I am not to be soft with Catherine. She is my wife, and it’s <strong>shameful </strong>  that she should wish to leave me.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/74/11.mp3">
      He says she hates me and wants me to die, that she may have my money, but she won’t have it, and she won’t go home! She may cry and be sick as much as she pleases!”

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/74/12.mp3">
      “Master Linton,” I said “have you forgotten all Catherine’s kindness to you last winter when you loved her, and when she brought you 
books and sang you songs and came many times through wind and 
snow to see you? She wept if she missed even one evening, thinking 
you would be <strong>disappointed. </strong>

      “He is in the court,” young Linton replied “talking to Dr Kenneth, who says Uncle is dying. I am glad, for I shall be the master of the Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as her house. It isn’t hers. It’s mine — Papa says everything she has is mine.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/75/6.mp3">
      Yesterday, when I wanted her to give me her gold case, she refused and pushed me off and hurt me. When Papa came up to see what the matter was, I told him all. He struck her down and since then, she had not spoken to me.”

      On reaching home, I immediately went to see my master, who looked considerably weak now. He murmured Catherine’s name when he saw me. I touched his hand and spoke.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/76/2.mp3">
      “Catherine is coming, dear Master!” I whispered. “She is alive and well and will be here, I hope tonight.”

      He half rose, looked eagerly around the apartment, and then sank back unconscious. As soon as he recovered, I related our visit and <strong>detention</strong> at the Heights.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/76/4.mp3">
      I said as little as possible against young Linton, and I did not describe all Heathcliff’s brutal conduct, as that would have affected him so much.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/76/5.mp3">
      But Mr. Edgar realised immediately from the nature of events that perhaps the chief purpose of Heathcliff was to secure his property and estate to his son, or rather to himself.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/76/6.mp3">
      Mr. Edgar decided to change his will, and instead of leaving Catherine’s fortune at her disposal, he determined to put it in the hands of <strong>trustees</strong> for her use during life, and her children after her. In this manner, it could not fall into Mr. Heathcliff’s hands when Mr. Edgar died.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/76/7.mp3">
      My master then asked me to send for Mr. Green, our lawyer, at once, so I sent a man to fetch him. I also sent four of our men, armed with weapons, to free Catherine.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/76/8.mp3">
      The servant returned first, with the sad news that Mr. Green was held up with something and would not be able to come before the next morning. The four men also came empty-handed — they were told that our lady was too ill to quit the room.
    </p>

      I went to open the door, thinking it was our lawyer, Mr. Green. But on opening, I saw my sweet little mistress, who sprang on my neck sobbing.

      She wanted to run to her father’s room <strong>immediately</strong>, but I stopped her to wash her face and tidy her hair so her ruffled features would not trouble her father. Then, I went myself alone to break this news to him, as sudden excitement could prove dangerous to him.

      Besides, I wished to let the father and daughter have their meeting free of any unwanted presence. When Catherine entered her father’s room, she supported him calmly, and he fixed his eyes on her features.

      He never spoke again, but continued that radiant gaze until his soul left him. None could have noticed the exact time of his death, which was so completely without a struggle. Catherine sat by her father, dry eyed until the sun rose.

      She sat until noon and would have remained <strong>brooding over</strong> the deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some rest.

      Mr. Green gave all the servants, except me, a notice to quit. Catherine herself, now Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had been allowed to stay until her father’s <strong>corpse</strong> had left the Grange.

      Without any medical attendance, Linton deteriorated fast and died one night, leaving all his and his wife Catherine’s property to his father, Mr. Heathcliff. As a result, Catherine lives there <strong>penniless</strong>, without a friend, and totally at the mercy of her father-in-law.

      However, what Zillah told me later lifted my spirits in some way.
    <br>
      It turned out that she was not entirely friendless there, and the young Hareton was <strong>keen</strong> on making friends with her. She repulsed him at first, but gradually began to show some affection towards him. However, I felt it was a welcome development.

      I decided to visit the Heights the next day, as I was feeling much better now. I wanted to inform my landlord to look for some other tenant starting from October, as I did not wish to spend my winter here. But my real motive behind this visit was to see the main characters of this story.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/1.mp3">
      Before I set out, Mrs. Dean requested me to take a little note from her to Cathy, to which I gladly agreed.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/2.mp3">
      As I approached the place, I found the gates fastened, as usual. As I knocked, Hareton appeared from the garden and, opening the gates, took me inside.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/3.mp3">
      I asked if Mr. Heathcliff was at home, to which he answered “No” I expressed my wish to wait for him, secretly feeling happy inside. 
    </p>

        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/4.mp3">
      We entered together. Catherine was there preparing some vegetables 
for the approaching meal. She looked sulkier and less spirited than 
when I had seen her first. She did not even raise her eyes in response 
to my greeting, and continued with her work in the same manner.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/5.mp3">
      After she had finished, she retired to a <strong>stool</strong> by the window and sat there, looking outside, silently. I approached her, pretending to view the garden, and quietly dropped Mrs. Dean’s note on her knee; but she asked aloud “What is that?”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/6.mp3">
      “A letter from Mrs. Dean” I answered. As she was getting up to pick the note, Hareton seized it and put it in his <strong>waistcoat</strong>, saying Mr. Heathcliff was to look at it first. At this, Catherine silently turned her face from us and quietly wiped her eyes with her handkerchief.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/7.mp3">
      To my surprise, Hareton pulled out the letter and threw it on the floor beside her, as <strong>ungraciously</strong> as he could. Catherine caught it and read it eagerly.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/8.mp3">
      “Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said after some time had passed “won’t you give a reply to this? I shall be happy to carry it. My housekeeper seems so attached to you, and she will be greatly disappointed if I return with no words from you.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/83/9.mp3">

      “No books!” I exclaimed “How do you live without them?”
    <br>
      “I was always reading when I had them,” said Catherine “but Mr. Heathcliff destroyed all my books,”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/2.mp3">
      “Only once, Hareton,” she said, looking at him “I came to find a secret <strong>stock</strong> in your room, some Latin and Greek books, and some tales and poetry. I brought the latter here, but you gathered them up. 
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/3.mp3">
     They are of no use to you — or else you hid them because you think 
what you cannot enjoy, nobody else shall. Perhaps your jealousy 
made Mr. Heathcliff rob me of my treasure.”
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/4.mp3">
      Hareton blushed crimson when his cousin made this <strong>revelation</strong> of his private literary collection, and showed unpleasant denial of her accusations. “Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his knowledge,” I said “I am sure he will be a clever scholar in a few years.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/5.mp3">
      “And he wants to reduce me to a stupid person in the meantime,” answered Catherine.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/6.mp3">
      “Yes, I hear him trying to speak and read to himself, but he makes it ridiculous with his mistakes and mispronunciations. And he <strong>deliberately</strong> selects those books and passages which he knows are dear to me. I hate to have them spoiled in his mouth.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/7.mp3">
      Hareton’s chest heaved in silence for a minute. He showed great anger which was not easy to suppress. I rose and walked out, hoping it would help defuse the tension, and Hareton followed me.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/8.mp3">
      But in a moment, he was back with half a dozen books in his hand, which he threw into Catherine’s lap exclaiming “Take them! I never want to hear or read or think of them again!”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/84/9.mp3">
      Catherine opened one volume and began to read in the drawling tone of a beginner, then laughed and threw it away.

      Hareton could not endure this treatment. He slapped her on her cheek, gathered the books with <strong>indignation</strong> and threw them into the fire. As they started burning, he stood there, looking in triumph.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/85/2.mp3">
      He was not to be blamed, as his feelings were hurt beyond measure.

     Hareton had been content with his daily labour and rough animal

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/85/4.mp3">
      Avoiding her scorn and gaining some approval from her was the chief sentiment that had put him on the path of self-learning. But alas, it turned out the opposite, and caused bitterness between them.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/85/5.mp3">
      “Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!” cried Catherine, watching the books burning before them.<br> “You had better hold your tongue now,” he returned fiercely. 
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/85/6.mp3">
 He looked quite agitated and went out hastily. But Mr. Heathcliff, who was coming up the <strong>causeway</strong> at that moment, saw Hareton’s troubled face and, gazing, let out a sigh.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/85/7.mp3">
      “It will be odd if I thwart myself,” Heathcliff muttered, unconscious that I was behind him.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/85/9.mp3">
      Heathcliff bent his eyes to the ground and walked in. There was a restless, anxious expression on his face. Catherine, on seeing him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so I remained alone.

                I answered that I did. She called for Mr. Littimer to join us
                and instructed him to tell me everything that had happened since
                Emily left Yarmouth.

                Mr. Littimer began quietly, “Mr. James and myself have been
                abroad with the young woman ever since she left Yarmouth. We
                have travelled <strong>extensively</strong>. We have been in
                France, Switzerland, Italy, all over the place. Mr. James was
                very fond of the young woman and helped her improve herself in
                her manners, dress and language. The young lady was admired
                wherever she went. Unfortunately, she became restless and
                depressed and Mr. James became very impatient with her. Finally,
                one morning, he left for Naples and told me to tell the young
                woman that he had gone. He said that she should marry a

                Littimer <strong>paused</strong> and could not look me in the
                eye. “It was necessary to restrain her because she took Mr.
                James’ departure very badly and I was worried that she might
                harm herself. Later that night, she climbed out of a small

                I quickly invited him to eat dinner with us and spend the night
                at my aunt’s cottage, because Dora was not well enough to
                receive visitors. Mr. Dick and my aunt received him warmly and

                have done us a great service, Mr. Micawber,” she said. “I’m sure

                Dora appeared weaker every month that passed. I began to believe
                that I would never see her walking and running again. Jip also
                grew old. His sight was weak and his bones were old. One
                evening, Dora asked me to send for Agnes. She arrived quickly

                <strong>cheerful</strong> for the whole evening. I was so happy

                out and died.

                When we arrived, the villagers could not believe that the coach
                had been able to get through such
                <strong>treacherous</strong> weather and that we had survived
                such a dangerous journey.

                Leaving my luggage at the inn, I went down to the sea. Women
                were crying for their men still out in the stormy waters in
                their fishing boats. I walked for a while looking for Ham, but
                was told that he was away from Yarmouth and would return in the
                morning.

                In the distance I could see six men hanging to the mast of a
                <strong>wrecked</strong> ship. The ship was being tossed about
                in the angry waves and when I looked again only two men were
                left clinging to the mast.

                I watched the crowd and to my surprise saw Ham amongst the
                villagers. I watched as he tied a rope around his waist, and I
                realised he was going into the cruel sea. I ran to him and
                begged him not to risk his life but he shook me off and waded
                into the waves.

                I watched as his body was dashed against the wreckage and as I
                stood mesmerized, the shipwreck sank
                <strong>beneath</strong> the waves and Ham was being carried,
                unconscious, to the shore. Not just unconscious, but dead. I
                would never look into Ham’s smiling face again. I wept then for
                Ham, for myself and for Emily.

                I was in for another shock; not only was Ham dead, but
                Steerforth as well. Steerforth had been on the ship and had
                perished at sea. His body was carried to the inn and I knew that
                I would have to break the news of his death to Mrs. Steerforth.

                I travelled to Highgate but was told that Mrs. Steerforth was an
                invalid. She could not come down the stairs to meet with me, and
                so I was shown to her bedroom. She was not alone. Rosa Dartle
                was also there, looking at me suspiciously. I trembled as I
                tried to speak. Mrs. Steerforth looked at me and asked, “My son
                is ill?” I could only nod my agreement.

                I then explained, as best I could, all that had happened that
                fateful morning. Mrs. Steerforth moaned in pain as she fell back
                in her chair.

                My next painful duty was to <strong>conceal</strong> Ham’s death
                from Mr. Peggotty and Emily so that they left for Australia
                happy in their ignorance. I went in search of Mr. Micawber to
                ask him for his help in keeping this tragic news from the
                Peggotts. Mr. Micawber told me that they were sailing earlier
                than expected—the next day.

                The following day, Peggotty and I went to Gravesend and found
                the ship on the river. Martha told me that she, too, was
                travelling to Australia with Mr. Peggotty and Emily. I turned to
                Mr. Peggotty with love in my heart, “Good luck, you are a good
                man!” I embraced Mr. Peggotty, Emily, Martha and the Micawbers
                and watched the ship sail away, filled with people on their way
                to a new beginning.

                It was not long after that when I left England. I travelled from

                Italy. In my <strong>solitude</strong> I
                <strong>mourned</strong> my wife and cried for her death. I had
                not really kept in touch with those in England, just a few lines
                here and there from different cities. On arriving in different
                countries I found letters that had been forwarded to me.

                I opened and read one from Agnes. I was surprised to find that
                thoughts of Agnes were filling my head and my heart more and
                more often. I read her letter many times and wrote to her before

                I continued my travelling and picked up my pen once more and
                began to write. I worked from early in the morning until late at
                night and finally finished a story. I sent it to Traddles and he
                arranged for its publication. With this success I set to work in
                earnest. Not only was I writing well, I was taking exercise,
                feeling fit and healthy.

                Agnes and I wrote regularly and I came to realise that I loved

                After three long years abroad, I returned to England, landing in
                London one autumn evening. I immediately went to see Traddles,
                who was now working as a lawyer. He had finally married his
                pretty Sophy. I found him in his chambers and told the clerk
                that I wished to see him. “Goodness!” cried Traddles, “It’s
                Copperfield!” and rushed into my arms. “How wonderful to see
                you! You have grown so famous. When did you arrive, where have
                you come from? What have you been doing?”

                Traddles did not give me time to answer one question before he

                and I was delighted to see how happy they were. I spent a
                pleasant evening with the Traddles before spending my first

                well in their new country. Mr. Peggotty had become a

                My aunt smiled at me and looked me in the eye, “I expect she is,
                Trot. She doesn’t confide in me, but I expect she is.”

                This news made up my mind for me and the next morning I rode to
                Canterbury to see Agnes. Everything looked the same and I asked
                the new maid to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman wanted to
                see her. Agnes came into the room and I caught her in my arms.
                “Agnes, my dear girl!” I cried. “I have surprised you. I am so
                happy to see you again.”

                I held her quietly for a while and we spoke of Emily and Dora.
                “Tell me about yourself, Agnes,” not really wanting to know the
                answer.

                “What should I tell you?” she answered. “My father is well. You
                see us here, quiet in our own home. We have no problems now that
                we have our home back. Knowing that, dear Trotwood, you know
                everything.”

                I looked at her and asked if there was anything else I should
                know. She told me about her school and about her life with her
                father. I went for a walk by myself, promising that I would
                return later when Mr. Wickfield was at home.

                On my return to the Wickfield home, I was
                <strong>greeted</strong> with love and delight by the old man.
                After dinner, Agnes played the piano. I tried to tell Agnes that
                I loved her, but it was impossible.

                I returned to Dover and stayed with my aunt while I finished my
                book. I had been in England for two months and it was around
                Christmas time. I had visited Agnes regularly, but she had said
                nothing of a new friend and my hopes had begun to rise. I
                decided to go and visit her one cold and
                <strong>frosty</strong> morning.

                Before I left, my aunt told me that she thought that Agnes was
                seeing a young man and that she also thought that Agnes was to
                be married.

                I was sad and deep in thought as I rode to Canterbury. I found
                Agnes alone by the fire, reading a book. I sat beside her and
                told her that I needed to speak to her privately. She nodded
                encouragingly. “My dear Agnes, do you have a secret? Please let
                me share it” , She trembled as she looked down, away from my
                face. She then jumped up and hurried across the room, bursting
                into tears. “You are wrong, Trotwood,” she cried. “I have no
                secrets from you.”

                “Agnes,” I cried as I went to her side. “I must say what is in
                my heart. You have always been my guide and my support, Agnes,
                When I loved Dora, my love would have been incomplete without
                your sympathy.

                I held her in my arms. She still wept, but joyfully now. She
                shyly told me that she had loved me her whole life. The next day
                we rode to Dover to tell my aunt the good news. We found her

                My aunt hugged and kissed us both. She was overjoyed. Peggotty
                hugged and kissed us both, as did Mr. Dick. My aunt said that
                she had always hoped that I would marry Agnes and it was me that
                she had meant when she said that she thought Agnes had a special
                friend. Unfortunately, I had been too <strong>blind</strong> to

                and was doing well for himself. Before Mr. Peggotty returned to
