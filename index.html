                  Emily Jane Brontë an English novelist and poet, was born in
                  July, 1818 in Thornton, Yorkshire, England. Emily was part of
                  a talented literary family. Her sisters, Charlotte and Anne,
                  also became well-known writers.

                  Emily’s formal education began when she attended the Clergy
                  Daughters’ School at Cowan Bridge, but she was later removed
                  from the school along with her sisters due to poor conditions
                  and the outbreak of tuberculosis. After leaving the school,
                  Emily was primarily educated at home by her father.

                  Emily Brontë’s literary career is primarily centered around
                  “Wuthering Heights” which was published in 1847 under the
                  pseudonym Ellis Bell.

                  The novel is known for its dark, passionate characters and its
                  exploration of themes such as love, revenge, and the
                  supernatural. Despite initial mixed reviews, “Wuthering
                  Heights” gained popularity over time and is now considered one
                  of the greatest novels in the English language.

                  Emily Brontë led a relatively secluded life, spending much of
                  her time with her family at the parsonage in Haworth,
                  Yorkshire. She was known for her love of nature and her
                  solitary nature. Her experiences growing up in the rugged
                  Yorkshire moors greatly influenced her writing, providing the
                  atmospheric backdrop for her novels.

                  Emily Brontë’s literary career was cut short by illness. She
                  died of tuberculosis in December 1848 at the age of 30, just
                  one year after the publication of “Wuthering Heights.”

                  “Wuthering Heights” is a timeless classic of English
                  literature, written by Emily Brontë and published in 1847. Set
                  against the atmospheric backdrop of the Yorkshire moors,
                  Brontë’s only novel is tackled the haunting tale of love,
                  revenge, and the destructive power of passion.

                  At its heart, “Wuthering Heights” explores the tumultuous
                  relationships between the inhabitants of two neighboring
                  households: the Earnshaws of Wuthering Heights and the Lintons
                  of Thrushcross Grange. Through the eyes of the narrator, Mr.
                  Lockwood, and later through the recollections of the
                  housekeeper, Nelly Dean, the reader is drawn into a complex
                  web of family secrets, forbidden love, and vengeful obsession.

                  Central to the novel is the passionate and destructive love
                  between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, an orphaned boy
                  taken in by the Earnshaw family. Their bond defies social
                  conventions and transcends mere affection, but it is also
                  marked by jealousy, manipulation, and cruelty.

                  As the story unfolds, Brontë delves deep into the dark
                  recesses of the human psyche, exploring themes of class
                  conflict, revenge, and the cyclical nature of violence.

                  The novel’s setting plays a crucial role in shaping its mood
                  and atmosphere. The desolate Yorkshire moors mirror the wild
                  and untamed emotions of the characters, while the isolated and
                  windswept landscape serves as a metaphor for their turbulent
                  inner lives.

                  From the imposing presence of the titular Wuthering Heights to

                  society and the characters themselves.

                  In the year 1801, having just returned from visiting my

                  find myself in a location far away from society, slightly
                  solitary, yet its innate charm captivates me. This place
                  appeals to me. As my landlord appeared, sporting a stern and

                  While crossing the threshold, I came to notice some strange On
                  the main door and among them, two words: “1500” and “Hareton
                  Earnshaw.” This aroused my curiosity to know something of the
                  history of this place from its owner, but his gruff and
                  impatient manner <strong>put me off</strong>.

                  One more step brought us into the family’s sitting room, which
                  they call here the house. It included a kitchen and a parlour,
                  but here, the kitchen seemed shifted inside, as I did not see
                  any sign of roasting, boiling or baking near the huge
                  fireplace.

                  Besides, I could hear the clutter of utensils and feminine
                  voices coming from inside. At the other end of the room,
                  however, I could see rows of dishes, silver jugs and
                  <strong>tankards</strong> stacked up to the roof.

                  The apartment and furniture looked typically like of a
                  northern farmer’s, but the owner stood in complete contrast to
                  them. His appearance was that of a <strong>gypsy</strong>, but
                  he was dressed and had the manners of a gentleman. His look
                  was unhappy, with a hint of ill-bred pride. As we settled in
                  our seats across each other, he ordered Joseph to bring some
                  tea.

                  Probably with a view to being nice to his tenant, he started a
                  conversation. He touched on different topics, and I could not

                  As I took his leave, I had made up my mind to pay him another
                  visit the next day. The following afternoon was cold, and I
                  reached the Heights just in time to escape the first flakes of

                  Beside the fire, I was pleased to notice a young miss whose

                  waited for a seat to be offered, but she kept looking fixedly

                  “You should not have come out,” said the lady finally, rising.
                  She was fair, with a round and pretty face, and golden locks
                  hanging loosely around her neck. She had beautiful eyes, but

                  too, as those of a labourer, his <strong>bearing</strong> was

                  The business of eating being over, I approached a window to
                  examine the weather. It was sorrowful. The night was
                  descending early, and a cold, bitter wind was blowing. A storm

                  Heathcliff told Zillah to give me a glass of water and then
                  left. Sick and helpless, I was freed to spend my night with my
                  inhospitable neighbour. While leading me upstairs, Zillah
                  recommended that I should hide the candle and not make a

                  of a chair and an oak case with squares cut near the top
                  resembling windows. In fact, it formed a little closet, and
                  the <strong>ledge</strong> of the window served as a table. I

                  hand had closed upon it. I tried to draw back my arm, but the

                  his hands, and his <strong>agitation</strong> was so extreme
                  that he could hardly pick it up. “It is only your guest, sir,”

                  of work and, drawing her seat near, began — Before I came to
                  live here, I mostly stayed at Wuthering Heights, because my
                  mother raised Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, Hareton’s father, and I
                  used to play with the children. One fine morning, as Mr.
                  Earnshaw, the old master, was about to go to Liverpool, he
                  instructed Joseph about the day’s work. And after kissing
                  goodbye his children, Catherine and Hindley, he set off for
                  the journey.

                  That boy was Heathcliff, and this was Heathcliff’s first
                  introduction to the family. Soon, Cathy and Heathcliff became
                  very friendly, but Hindley hated him. Hindley’s cruelties to
                  him only made Heathcliff dearer to my master. Heathcliff
                  himself was a <strong>sullen, ill-disposed</strong> child, and
                  I could never understand why my master had taken a fancy to

                  <strong>benefactor</strong>, but simply insensible and never
                  showed any sign of gratitude. Knowing perfectly what hold he

                  speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his

                  Over time, Mr. Earnshaw’s health began to fail, and he grew
                  more possessive towards Heathcliff, his object of affection.
                  Any insult to Heathcliff on Hindley’s part drove the old man
                  to fury, with the result that Heathcliff’s pride and black
                  temper grew more vicious. Lastly, our priest, as a solution,
                  suggested that Hindley be sent to college, and Mr. Earnshaw
                  agreed.

                  One October evening, Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair.
                  The house was without a master now. When the news reached
                  Hindley, he arrived for the funeral with a wife, much to the
                  amazement of all.

                  On his return, Hindley settled himself as the master of the
                  house. On the very first occasion, he told Joseph and me that
                  we must move to the back kitchen.

                  He had the air of a man of the world now. His wife expressed
                  pleasure at having Catherine as a sister-in-law, and gave her
                  many presents. But her affections tired very soon, and she
                  became easily annoyed. Hindley, too, grew
                  <strong>tyrannical</strong>.

                  After Mr. Earnshaw’s death, Hindley remembered his father as
                  an <strong>oppressor</strong> and saw Heathcliff as a
                  <strong>usurper</strong> of his parent’s affections and
                  privileges. A few words from his wife indicating her dislike
                  for Heathcliff were sufficient to arouse all his hatred for
                  the boy. He drove him from their company and forced him to
                  work outdoors as hard as any other boy on the farm.

                  Heathcliff bore his <strong>degradation</strong> rather
                  easily, because Catherine told him what she learnt and also
                  played with him in the fields. They both promised to grow up
                  as rude as savages, Hindley being entirely negligent of all
                  this as they kept clear of him.

                  One Sunday evening, Heathcliff and Cathy were banished from
                  the sitting room for making some noise. At supper time, they
                  could not be found anywhere. Their wild uncontrollable manners
                  gave me a clue of the hard times to come. I retired to bed
                  with a heavy heart.

                  called Hareton. Mr. Hindley saw the little baby was healthy,
                  and never heard him cry, so he remained contented.

                  Hindley’s treatment of Heathcliff now was enough to make an

                  The <strong>curate</strong> stopped calling, and nobody decent
                  came near us except Edgar Linton, son of Mr. Linton of
                  Thrushcross Grange, who had lately been quite impressed with
                  Cathy’s beauty. At fifteen, she was the queen of the
                  countryside, but she was a naughty and headstrong creature.

                  In fact, even I did not like her arrogance. Heathcliff kept
                  his hold on Cathy’s affections, and the young Linton found it
                  difficult to make an equally deep impression on her with all
                  his superiority.
                  <br />
                  Edgar Linton was always received with civility in Wuthering
                  Heights, but his visits had started a struggle inside
                  Catherine. All the gentlemanly ways of Edgar necessitated that
                  Cathy too behaved accordingly, but the rustic and unpolished
                  temperament within her found it difficult to cope with this.

                  Both she and Heathcliff poured <strong>contempt</strong> on
                  him in his absence. But when Edgar showed disgust for and
                  <strong>antipathy</strong> to Heathcliff in some measure, she
                  had to accept it. Edgar’s visits troubled her as she found it
                  difficult to keep a double character. I knew of her
                  <strong>perplexities</strong> but did not say anything until
                  one day she came to me herself.

                  “As I said, sir, I went to Thrushcross Grange with Miss
                  Catherine. I was amazed to see that she behaved infinitely
                  better than I had expected. She seemed almost quite fond of
                  Edgar and showed plenty of affection even towards his sister,
                  Isabella. I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of
                  <strong>ruffling</strong> her humour. If anybody fidgeted
                  against her wishes or orders, Mr. Linton immediately showed
                  his displeasure. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence,
                  but everyone behaved so sympathetically that I began to hope
                  that the time of peace and happiness was there to stay now.
                  But, alas, I was wrong.”

                  him as if she feared he would vanish if she took her eyes off

                  ordinary tone and a measure of politeness. Catherine came to

                  The meal was over in ten minutes, and Heathcliff departed in

                  Earnshaw had invited him! I grew

                  him. At last, he turned and stared hard at her as one might do
                  at a strange, repulsive animal. Isabella could not bear that
                  and grew white and red in rapid succession and, to remove
                  herself from Catherine’s firm grip, dug her nails in her flesh
                  so hard that blood appeared. Exclaiming with pain, Catherine
                  set her free, and Isabella rushed out of the room.

                  After she had gone, Heathcliff turned towards Catherine and
                  asked, “Why were you teasing her in that manner, Cathy? You
                  were not speaking the truth, were you?”

                  “I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been waiting for
                  you for several weeks, and I have been greatly abused this
                  morning as I had tried to lessen her

                  I determined to watch Heathcliff’s movements. I wanted
                  something to happen which would free both Thrushcross Grange
                  and Wuthering Heights, quietly leaving us the peace of earlier
                  days. But Heathcliff’s visits continued as before, and I saw
                  an evil beast in him, waiting for his chance to jump to her.

                  The next time Heathcliff came, Isabella was feeding some
                  pigeons in the court. She and Catherine had not spoken to each
                  other for three days. Heathcliff had not been in the habit of
                  paying attention to Isabella earlier; but today, he stopped
                  and, after cautiously surveying the place, stepped forwards
                  and said something to her.

                Edgar tried to take the key from Catherine’s grasp, but she
                flung it into the fire. Mr. Edgar was taken aback with
                trembling, and his face grew deadly pale. He could not suppress
                his emotions, and anguish and humiliation overcame him
                completely.

                servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through
                the house quietly and exchanging whispers as they encountered
                each other during their work. Everyone was active except Miss
                Isabella. The servants began to remark how soundly Isabella
                slept, and her brother, too, asked if she had shown any anxiety
                for her sister-in-law. Then, suddenly, one of the maids came
                panting upstairs and cries “Master, Master, Isabella is gone —
                she is gone; Heathcliff’s ran off with her.”

                “That’s not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising with agitation “Go
                and find her.” I ran and <strong>peeped</strong> into Isabella’s
                room, confirming when I returned, the servant’s
                <strong>statement</strong>. Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by
                the bed and, on my coming back, read the meaning of my
                <strong>blank</strong> aspect and dropped his eyes without
                giving an order or uttering a word.

                For two months, the <strong>fugitives</strong> remained absent.
                In those months, Catherine, who had brain fever, lay between
                life and death. No mother could have nursed a child more
                <strong>devotedly</strong> than Edgar tended her. Day and night
                he sat there, watching and tending her, caring nothing for his
                own health. At last, when the doctor announced her life was out
                of danger, it was as if Edgar was recovering a new life.

                Though the doctor was worried that she might never get back the

                due in a short time.

                Some six weeks after the flight, Isabella sent a short note to
                her brother announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. At the
                bottom was an <strong>obscure</strong> apology and a request for
                <strong>reconciliation</strong>, but Edgar did not reply to
                this. Two weeks later, I received a long letter from her which
                made me sadly aware of the misery she was in.

                As I had feared, she had been receiving abuse and ill-treatment
                at the hands of Heathcliff from the moment she stepped into
                Wuthering Heights. She pleaded with me to ask her brother’s
                forgiveness and come to her at the earliest opportunity

                The poor creature understood now that she had become a pawn in
                Heathcliff’s game of revenge. I informed Mr. Linton of the state
                of affairs, but he did nothing. However, he allowed me to visit
                Wuthering Heights.

                Mr. Edgar’s refusal to be reconciled with his sister had

                When I reached the Heights, I saw her looking through the
                window. I entered without knocking. She looked pale and
                listless, and her dress was dirty and <strong>crumpled</strong>.
                She came forwards eagerly to greet me and held out her hand for
                the expected letter.

                I shook my head, and her lip quivered slightly, and that was
                all. Upon his enquiry, I told Heathcliff about Cathy’s illness
                and asked him to stay away from the Grange if he really cared
                for her to recover.

                But Heathcliff was <strong>adamant</strong> and kept pressing me
                for an interview with her, threatening he would manage it
                himself if I did not cooperate. I tried to dissuade him, saying
                that meeting her now was only going to increase her distress. In
                the end, seeing no other way, I agreed to carry a letter from
                him to Catherine.

                It was only on the fourth day that I could bring that letter to

                to read it herself, as she did not know from whom it came.

                When I said it was from Mr. Heathcliff, she gave a start, and a
                troubled <strong>gleam</strong> of
                <strong>recollection</strong> came to her eyes. She lifted the
                letter, but again let it fall and gazed at me with questioning
                eyes.

                Heathcliff, meanwhile, had begun to doubt my promise as four
                days had passed without any information, and so he came to the

                The next twelve years were the happiest of my life. I was the
                nurse and mother to baby Catherine, and except for
                <strong>trifling</strong> illnesses, she had a wonderful
                <strong>constitution</strong>. She grew into a real beauty. She
                had inherited Mr. Earnshaw’s handsome dark eyes and Mr. Linton’s
                fair skin and small features. Her spirit was high, her anger was
                never furious and her love, never fierce. Edgar took on her
                education entirely himself, as he was pleased to find that she
                had curiosity and a quick intellect. She learnt rapidly and
                eagerly, and this made her an <strong>apt</strong> scholar.

                brother to forgive her and come so she could place her son
                Linton in his hands safely and die in peace.

                dragging him roughly between his knees “Nelly, if you are tired,

                Catherine did not see her cousin again for a long time, and
                before she did, his features had become so dim in her memory
                that she could not recognise him. However, I used to ask the
                housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, whenever I chanced to
                encounter him, how Linton was getting on.

                I was told he continued to be in weak health. Heathcliff

                There was hardly any talk between them. Linton himself was
                selfish and disagreeable, and his continuous sulking annoyed
                everyone in the house. My interest in him consequently
                <strong>decayed</strong>, though I was moved with a sense of
                grief at his condition and a wish that he had been left with us.

                This 20<sup>th</sup> of March was a beautiful spring day. My
                young lady came down, dressed for going out, and asked me to
                accompany her. Mr. Linton had given permission if we went only a
                short distance and were back within an hour.

                I put on my bonnet and came out. Cathy bounded before me like a
                young greyhound, her golden locks flying in the air and her eyes
                <strong>radiant</strong> with happiness.

                “Oh, a little further — only a little,” was her reply,
                continually. At length, I began to feel tired. Before long, she
                had come close to Wuthering Heights. I saw some people
                surrounding her, one of whom, I felt sure, looked like Mr.

                After some time had passed, Linton started showing signs of
                uneasiness, perhaps
                <strong>repenting</strong> that he had denied himself the treat

                reaching over to gather some buds that blossomed scarlet on the

                I pulled away from Cathy to close the door, rolled a stone
                against it to hold it, and then spreading my umbrella, for the
                rain had begun, drew Cathy underneath.

                As we hurried towards home, I felt instinctively that
                Catherine’s heart was now clouded in darkness, for she seemed to
                regard Heathcliff’s words as true.

                In the evening, as she lay on the rug weeping silently, I tried
                to make her understand the falseness of Mr. Heathcliff’s
                <strong>assertions</strong>, but could not
                <strong>counteract</strong> the effect he had produced.

                She said to me “You may be right, Ellen, but I shall never feel
                at ease until I know.” The <strong>premonition</strong> was
                clear to me. Next day, I found myself on the road to Wuthering

                I hoped that Linton himself, by his reception of us, might prove
                how

                However, I was wrong in hoping that. The meeting of the two
                cousins only succeeded in rekindling their old attachment. They
                were more drawn to each other now than ever, as one wanted love
                and sympathy, and the other almost craved to give it.

                Unfortunately, I caught a cold on the next morning of our visit
                and was laid up for three weeks. All these three weeks, my
                little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me

                At the end of the three weeks, I had recovered enough to leave
                my bed and move about the house. On the first evening, as I sat
                in a chair, feeling dull, I asked Catherine to read to me.

                She consented rather unwillingly, I thought. The following
                night, she seemed more impatient, and on the third, she
                complained of a headache and left me.

                Spring advanced, yet my master gathered no real strength, though
                he would walk in the grounds with his daughter. He wrote to
                Linton again, expressing his great desire to see him, but both
                times, he replied saying that his father, Mr. Heathcliff,
                objected to his calling at the Grange. Linton had written:

                Soon, it was June. Though the climate had warmed up, my master’s
                health kept <strong>deteriorating</strong>. Linton’s letters
                came now and then, all with the same wish of an interview with

                However, Mr. Edgar could not consent to it because his health
                did not allow him to accompany her. Linton’s health, also, was
                failing fast, but we had no idea of this as Heathcliff did not

                However, one day, when summer was past, Edgar reluctantly gave

                Catherine was grieved at his sight. The expression of joy on her

                Catherine tried to cheer him up, but Linton showed no interest;

                sullen and regarded the sympathy of others as an insult to him.

                On the fifth afternoon, Zillah opened my room, releasing me from
                this confinement. She told me that people thought we had sunk in
                the <strong> marsh,</strong> and her master had saved us.

                Soon, I had removed the earth from her coffin and was about to
                open it when I heard a sigh close at my ear. I appeared to feel
                a warm breath — I knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by
                — I felt that Cathy was there, not under me but on earth. A
                sudden sense of relief flowed my heart, through every limb. I
                was consoled because I knew her presence was with me — she led
                me home.

                Catherine had accepted her fate, but cut herself off from all

                It turned out that she was not entirely friendless there, and

                I could not overhear anything further, but on looking around
                again, I saw two such radiant faces that I did not doubt the two
                enemies had now become friends.

                Since then, the <strong>intimacy</strong> between them grew
                <strong>rapidly</strong>, though with its usual highs and lows.
                Their minds were tending to the same point: one loving and
                desiring to esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be
                esteemed, and they <strong>managed</strong> to reach it in the
                end.

                Heathcliff remained more withdrawn. However, when one morning
                Catherine confronted him by saying that she and Hareton were
                friends now, and Hareton would not obey him anymore, he flew
                into a rage.

                “Damnable witch!” thundered Heathcliff “Dare you pretend to
                rouse him against me? Off with her! Do you hear? I will kill
                her, Ellen, if you let her come into my sight again.”

                By now, Heathcliff had his hand in her hair. Hareton attempted
                to release her locks, begging Heathcliff not to hurt her.
                Heathcliff’s black eyes flashed, and he seemed ready to tear
                Catherine into pieces.

                Suddenly, his fingers relaxed, and he shifted his grasp from her
                head to her arm and gazed intently in her face. Then, he drew
                his hand over his eyes, and turning again to Catherine, said
                with calmness “You must not put me in a passion, or I shall
                murder you some time.

                I led Catherine out and advised her to remain upstairs at dinner
                time. Mr. Heathcliff had his dinner alone; he spoke very little,
                ate still less and went out afterwards, saying that he would not
                return before evening.

                We stayed to see it covered, praying that Heathcliff would sleep
                soundly in death. But if you ask the country folk, they will
                swear they saw Heathcliff walk near the church, on the moor.

                One little boy swore that he had seen him walking with a woman
                by his side. I did not see anything, yet I do not like being by
                myself in this grim house, and I shall be glad when Catherine
                and Hareton move to the Grange as soon as they are married on
                New Year’s Day.

                It seemed as if a heavy burden lifted off my heart; the story
                was finally over. The struggle of unfulfilled souls had ended,

                I began my walk home, but something urged me, and so I took the
                direction of the church, where I saw three headstones on the
                slope.

                I lingered around them under the merciful sky, wondering how
                anyone could ever imagine the unquiet sleep for the people
                buried in that quiet earth.
