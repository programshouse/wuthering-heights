                  Emily Jane Brontë an English novelist and poet, was born in
                  July, 1818 in Thornton, Yorkshire, England. Emily was part of
                  a talented literary family. Her sisters, Charlotte and Anne,
                  also became well-known writers.

                  Emily’s formal education began when she attended the Clergy
                  Daughters’ School at Cowan Bridge, but she was later removed
                  from the school along with her sisters due to poor conditions
                  and the outbreak of tuberculosis. After leaving the school,
                  Emily was primarily educated at home by her father.

                  Emily Brontë’s literary career is primarily centered around
                  “Wuthering Heights” which was published in 1847 under the
                  pseudonym Ellis Bell.

                  The novel is known for its dark, passionate characters and its
                  exploration of themes such as love, revenge, and the
                  supernatural. Despite initial mixed reviews, “Wuthering
                  Heights” gained popularity over time and is now considered one
                  of the greatest novels in the English language.

                  Emily Brontë led a relatively secluded life, spending much of
                  her time with her family at the parsonage in Haworth,
                  Yorkshire. She was known for her love of nature and her
                  solitary nature. Her experiences growing up in the rugged
                  Yorkshire moors greatly influenced her writing, providing the
                  atmospheric backdrop for her novels.

                  died of tuberculosis in December 1848 at the age of 30, just
                  one year after the publication of “Wuthering Heights.”

                  “Wuthering Heights” is a timeless classic of English
                  literature, written by Emily Brontë and published in 1847. Set
                  against the atmospheric backdrop of the Yorkshire moors,
                  Brontë’s only novel is tackled the haunting tale of love,
                  revenge, and the destructive power of passion.

                  At its heart, “Wuthering Heights” explores the tumultuous
                  relationships between the inhabitants of two neighboring
                  households: the Earnshaws of Wuthering Heights and the Lintons
                  of Thrushcross Grange. Through the eyes of the narrator, Mr.
                  Lockwood, and later through the recollections of the
                  housekeeper, Nelly Dean, the reader is drawn into a complex
                  web of family secrets, forbidden love, and vengeful obsession.

                  Central to the novel is the passionate and destructive love
                  between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, an orphaned boy
                  taken in by the Earnshaw family. Their bond defies social
                  conventions and transcends mere affection, but it is also
                  marked by jealousy, manipulation, and cruelty.

                  As the story unfolds, Brontë delves deep into the dark
                  recesses of the human psyche, exploring themes of class
                  conflict, revenge, and the cyclical nature of violence.

                  The novel’s setting plays a crucial role in shaping its mood
                  and atmosphere. The desolate Yorkshire moors mirror the wild
                  and untamed emotions of the characters, while the isolated and
                  windswept landscape serves as a metaphor for their turbulent
                  inner lives.

                  From the imposing presence of the titular Wuthering Heights to

                  society and the characters themselves.

                  In the year 1801, having just returned from visiting my

                  find myself in a location far away from society, slightly
                  solitary, yet its innate charm captivates me. This place

                  While crossing the threshold, I came to notice some strange On
                  the main door and among them, two words: “1500” and “Hareton
                  Earnshaw.” This aroused my curiosity to know something of the
                  history of this place from its owner, but his gruff and
                  impatient manner <strong>put me off</strong>.

                  One more step brought us into the family’s sitting room, which
                  they call here the house. It included a kitchen and a parlour,
                  but here, the kitchen seemed shifted inside, as I did not see
                  any sign of roasting, boiling or baking near the huge
                  fireplace.

                  Besides, I could hear the clutter of utensils and feminine
                  voices coming from inside. At the other end of the room,
                  however, I could see rows of dishes, silver jugs and
                  <strong>tankards</strong> stacked up to the roof.

                  The apartment and furniture looked typically like of a
                  northern farmer’s, but the owner stood in complete contrast to
                  them. His appearance was that of a <strong>gypsy</strong>, but
                  he was dressed and had the manners of a gentleman. His look
                  was unhappy, with a hint of ill-bred pride. As we settled in
                  our seats across each other, he ordered Joseph to bring some
                  tea.

                  Probably with a view to being nice to his tenant, he started a

                  As I took his leave, I had made up my mind to pay him another
                  visit the next day. The following afternoon was cold, and I
                  reached the Heights just in time to escape the first flakes of

                  Beside the fire, I was pleased to notice a young miss whose

                  waited for a seat to be offered, but she kept looking fixedly

                  She was fair, with a round and pretty face, and golden locks
                  hanging loosely around her neck. She had beautiful eyes, but

                  too, as those of a labourer, his <strong>bearing</strong> was

                  The business of eating being over, I approached a window to
                  examine the weather. It was sorrowful. The night was
                  descending early, and a cold, bitter wind was blowing. A storm

                  Heathcliff told Zillah to give me a glass of water and then

                  resembling windows. In fact, it formed a little closet, and

                  hand had closed upon it. I tried to draw back my arm, but the

                  his hands, and his <strong>agitation</strong> was so extreme
                  that he could hardly pick it up. “It is only your guest, sir,”

                  of work and, drawing her seat near, began — Before I came to
                  live here, I mostly stayed at Wuthering Heights, because my
                  mother raised Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, Hareton’s father, and I
                  used to play with the children. One fine morning, as Mr.
                  Earnshaw, the old master, was about to go to Liverpool, he
                  instructed Joseph about the day’s work. And after kissing
                  goodbye his children, Catherine and Hindley, he set off for
                  the journey.

                  That boy was Heathcliff, and this was Heathcliff’s first
                  introduction to the family. Soon, Cathy and Heathcliff became
                  very friendly, but Hindley hated him. Hindley’s cruelties to
                  him only made Heathcliff dearer to my master. Heathcliff
                  himself was a <strong>sullen, ill-disposed</strong> child, and
                  I could never understand why my master had taken a fancy to
                  him. Heathcliff was not <strong>insolent</strong> to his
                  <strong>benefactor</strong>, but simply insensible and never
                  showed any sign of gratitude. Knowing perfectly what hold he
                  had on Mr. Earnshaw’s heart and conscience, he had only to
                  speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his

                  Over time, Mr. Earnshaw’s health began to fail, and he grew
                  more possessive towards Heathcliff, his object of affection.
                  Any insult to Heathcliff on Hindley’s part drove the old man
                  to fury, with the result that Heathcliff’s pride and black
                  temper grew more vicious. Lastly, our priest, as a solution,
                  suggested that Hindley be sent to college, and Mr. Earnshaw
                  agreed.

                  One October evening, Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair.
                  The house was without a master now. When the news reached
                  Hindley, he arrived for the funeral with a wife, much to the
                  amazement of all.

                  On his return, Hindley settled himself as the master of the
                  house. On the very first occasion, he told Joseph and me that
                  we must move to the back kitchen.

                  He had the air of a man of the world now. His wife expressed
                  pleasure at having Catherine as a sister-in-law, and gave her
                  many presents. But her affections tired very soon, and she
                  became easily annoyed. Hindley, too, grew
                  <strong>tyrannical</strong>.

                  After Mr. Earnshaw’s death, Hindley remembered his father as
                  an <strong>oppressor</strong> and saw Heathcliff as a
                  <strong>usurper</strong> of his parent’s affections and
                  privileges. A few words from his wife indicating her dislike
                  for Heathcliff were sufficient to arouse all his hatred for
                  the boy. He drove him from their company and forced him to
                  work outdoors as hard as any other boy on the farm.

                  Heathcliff bore his <strong>degradation</strong> rather
                  easily, because Catherine told him what she learnt and also
                  played with him in the fields. They both promised to grow up
                  as rude as savages, Hindley being entirely negligent of all
                  this as they kept clear of him.

                  One Sunday evening, Heathcliff and Cathy were banished from
                  the sitting room for making some noise. At supper time, they
                  could not be found anywhere. Their wild uncontrollable manners
                  gave me a clue of the hard times to come. I retired to bed
                  with a heavy heart.

                  On a fine June day, a little baby was born to Mr. Hindley, but
                  the mother died soon after. I was now to nurse the child
                  called Hareton. Mr. Hindley saw the little baby was healthy,
                  and never heard him cry, so he remained contented.

                  Hindley’s treatment of Heathcliff now was enough to make an
                  enemy of even a saint. The house had indeed become infernal.
                  The <strong>curate</strong> stopped calling, and nobody decent
                  came near us except Edgar Linton, son of Mr. Linton of
                  Thrushcross Grange, who had lately been quite impressed with
                  Cathy’s beauty. At fifteen, she was the queen of the
                  countryside, but she was a naughty and headstrong creature.

                  In fact, even I did not like her arrogance. Heathcliff kept
                  his hold on Cathy’s affections, and the young Linton found it
                  difficult to make an equally deep impression on her with all
                  his superiority.
                  <br />
                  Edgar Linton was always received with civility in Wuthering
                  Heights, but his visits had started a struggle inside
                  Catherine. All the gentlemanly ways of Edgar necessitated that
                  Cathy too behaved accordingly, but the rustic and unpolished
                  temperament within her found it difficult to cope with this.

                  Both she and Heathcliff poured <strong>contempt</strong> on
                  him in his absence. But when Edgar showed disgust for and
                  <strong>antipathy</strong> to Heathcliff in some measure, she
                  had to accept it. Edgar’s visits troubled her as she found it
                  difficult to keep a double character. I knew of her
                  <strong>perplexities</strong> but did not say anything until
                  one day she came to me herself.

                  Mr. Hindley was not at home one afternoon, and Heathcliff had

        I felt ill, perhaps on account of my earlier adventure in the snow. The four weeks during which I remained bedridden, Mr. Heathcliff had paid a visit to enquire about my health. My curiosity had <strong>resurfaced</strong> now, and I called Mrs. Dean to pick up the story from where she had left it.

        “As I said, sir, I went to Thrushcross Grange with Miss Catherine. I was amazed to see that she behaved infinitely better than I had expected. She seemed almost quite fond of Edgar and showed plenty of affection even towards his sister, Isabella. I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of <strong>ruffling</strong> her humour. If anybody fidgeted against her wishes or orders, Mr. Linton immediately showed his displeasure. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence, but everyone behaved so sympathetically that I began to hope that the time of peace and happiness was there to stay now. But, alas, I was wrong.”

        On turning, I saw a tall, dark man coming towards me.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/2.mp3">
        “I have waited here an hour,” he began without daring to enter. “You know me. Look, I am not a stranger!”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/3.mp3">
        A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were yellow, half-covered with black whiskers, and the eyes deep set and strange. I remembered the eyes.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/4.mp3">
        “What!” I cried, raising my hand in amazement. “What! You have come back? Is it really you?”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/5.mp3">
        “Yes — Heathcliff,” he replied, <strong>glancing</strong> from me up to the windows, which showed no light from within.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/6.mp3">
        “Are they at home? Where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! You needn’t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word with her—your mistress. Go and say some person from Gimmerton village desires to see her.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/7.mp3">
        “How will she take it?” I exclaimed. “You are Heathcliff but so changed.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/8.mp3">
        “Go and carry my message,” he interrupted impatiently. “I am in hell until you do!”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/9.mp3">
        He lifted the <strong>latch</strong>, and I entered; Edgar and Cathy were sitting together in the window, looking beyond the garden trees and the valley. The room, its <strong>occupants</strong> and the scene they gazed at looked extremely peaceful. I shrank from performing my <strong>errand</strong> and was actually going away, leaving it unsaid, when it unexpectedly came out of me:

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/27/10.mp3">

        “What does he want?” asked Mr. Linton.

        “Well, close the curtains, Nelly,” she said, “and bring up tea. I will be back directly.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/2.mp3">
        After she went to see her visitor, Mr. Linton enquired carelessly who it was.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/3.mp3">
        “Someone Mistress does not expect,” I replied. “Heathcliff! You <strong>recollect</strong> him, sir. He used to live at Mr. Earnshaw’s.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/4.mp3">
        “What! The gypsy? The ploughboy?” he cried. “Why did you not say so to Catherine?”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/5.mp3">
        “Hush! You must not call him by those names, sir,” I said.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/6.mp3">
        “She would be sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off. I guess his return will please her greatly.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/7.mp3">
        Mr. Linton walked to a window and, peering out, said, “Do not stand there, love! Bring the person in.” Soon, I heard the click of the <strong>latch</strong>, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless, wild and too excited to show gladness.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/8.mp3">
        “Oh, Edgar, Edgar!” she <strong>panted</strong>, flinging her arms around his neck. “Heathcliff has come back — he has!” She tightened her embrace to a squeeze.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/9.mp3">
        “Well, well,” cried her husband <strong>crossly</strong> “don’t <strong>strangle</strong> me for that! He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to be <strong>frantic</strong>!”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/10.mp3">
        “I know, you didn’t like him,” she said, repressing the intensity of her delight a little. “Yet for my sake, be friends with him now. Shall I tell him to come up?”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/11.mp3">
        “No, Nelly will,” said Mr. Linton irritably.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/28/12.mp3">
        I descended and in a moment brought Heathcliff in the presence of my master and mistress. Catherine hastily moved up to him
     and, bringing him closer to Mr. Linton, made them shake hands. 
My master was at a loss for a minute or two as to how to address the 
ploughboy. In the light of the candles, he saw that Heathcliff was a 
tall, athletic man with an air of maturity about him.

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/29/1.mp3">
        Heathcliff bore no marks of former degradation and looked dignified despite the aggressiveness that was obvious in his fiery eyes.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/29/2.mp3">
        “Sit down, sir,” Mr. Linton said at last.

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/29/3.mp3">
        He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish if she took her eyes off him. He did not raise his eyes to her often but when he did, it showed undisguised delight. Mr. Edgar, who was noticing this for quite some time, grew pale with annoyance, which reached its climax when Cathy seized Heathcliff’s hand again.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/29/4.mp3">
        “I shall not be able to believe that I have seen and touched, and spoken to you again.” Catherine would have gone on like this, but Mr. Linton interrupted her.

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/29/5.mp3">
        “Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please come to the table,” he said, <strong>striving</strong> to preserve his ordinary tone and a measure of politeness. Catherine came to the table, and Miss Isabella, her sister-in-law, joined them. The meal was over in ten minutes, and Heathcliff departed in an hour. He was going to Wuthering Heights, as Mr. Hindley Earnshaw had invited him! I grew <strong>apprehensive</strong> as I knew what feelings Heathcliff could have towards him.
      </p>

        In the middle of the night I was awakened by Catherine, who took a seat on my bedside.

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/29/7.mp3">
        “I cannot rest, Ellen,” she said. “I want someone to keep my company in my happiness! Edgar is <strong>sulky</strong> because I am glad of a thing that does not interest him. I had only praised Heathcliff a little when he began to cry, so I got up and left him.”

        “What use is it, praising Heathcliff to him?” I said. “Even as <strong>lads</strong> they did not get along, and I don’t see any change in them now, either.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/2.mp3">
        “But it is childish. Heathcliff is a man of standing now, worthy of regard, and it would be our honour to befriend him. But when I said this to Edgar, he started shedding tears!”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/3.mp3">
        “What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?” I asked, wanting to change the subject.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/4.mp3">
        “He explained it,” she replied. “He had gone there to ask about me but was received by Hindley, who asked him to come in. There were some persons inside, playing cards. Heathcliff joined them. In a while, my brother lost some money to him and, finding him plentifully supplied, requested him to come again in the evening, to which Heathcliff agreed. Heathcliff says his reason for befriending my brother is to have more opportunities for meeting me.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/5.mp3">
        “Have you no fear of consequences, Mrs. Linton?” I asked her.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/6.mp3">
        “None,” she replied with a self–<strong>conviction</strong>, and departed saying she was going to make peace with Edgar.

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/7.mp3">
        How she won Edgar to her purpose, I do not know, but he did not give any sign of objection when Catherine set about visiting Wuthering Heights the following afternoon, taking Isabella with her. In return, she showered Edgar with such affection that it made the house a paradise for several days.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/30/8.mp3">
        But trouble seemed likely to happen. Heathcliff’s repeated visits to Thrushcross Grange were creating a fatal attraction in young Isabella’s mind for him. Mr. Linton was shocked when he became aware of this. Catherine also tried to dissuade Isabella, telling her that—
      beneath Heathcliff’s harsh appearance was an even harsher nature, 
pitiless, wolfish and feelingless.

        Catherine said, “He would crush you like a sparrow’s egg if he found you even a bit troublesome.” But young Isabella was too <strong>overwhelmed</strong> with the charm of Heathcliff.
      </br>
        She <strong>paid no heed</strong> to Catherine’s advice and rather accused her of trying to lower Heathcliff in her eyes.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/31/2.mp3">
        The next day, Heathcliff arrived earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were waiting in the library on hostile terms, but silent. As Heathcliff passed the window, I noticed a mischievous smile on Catherine’s lips.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/31/3.mp3">
        “Come in,” exclaimed my mistress as Heathcliff entered. “Here are two people sadly in need of a third to <strong>thaw</strong> the ice between them, and you are the very one we should choose. Heathcliff, here is someone who loves you more than myself. Nay, it’s not Nelly; don’t look at her. My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart over you. It lies in your own power to be Edgar’s brother. No, no, Isabella, you should not run off,” she continued, stopping Isabella, who had risen indignantly.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/31/4.mp3">
        “Catherine!” said Isabella, “I would thank you to adhere to the truth and not <strong>slander</strong> me, even if in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, please restrain Catherine, because what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/31/5.mp3">
        All the while, Heathcliff answered nothing and looked thoroughly 
indifferent to the sentiments of Isabella towards him. At last, he 
turned and stared hard at her as one might do at a strange, repulsive 
animal. Isabella could not bear that and grew white and red in rapid 
succession and, to remove herself from Catherine’s firm grip, dug 
her nails in her flesh so hard that blood appeared. Exclaiming with pain, Catherine set her free, and Isabella rushed out of the room.

        After she had gone, Heathcliff turned towards Catherine and asked, “Why were you teasing her in that manner, Cathy? You were not speaking the truth, were you?”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/32/2.mp3">
        “I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been waiting for you for several weeks, and I have been greatly abused this morning as I had tried to lessen her <strong>infatuation</strong> by naming some of your faults.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/32/3.mp3">
        I determined to watch Heathcliff’s movements. I wanted something to happen which would free both Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights, quietly leaving us the peace of earlier days.

      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/32/4.mp3">
        The next time Heathcliff came, Isabella was feeding some pigeons in the court. She and Catherine had not spoken to each other for three days. Heathcliff had not been in the habit of paying attention to Isabella earlier; but today, he stopped and, after cautiously surveying the place, stepped forwards and said something to her.
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/32/5.mp3">

        “I don’t care for his approval,” returned Heathcliff, “and I can do well without it. And as for you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a few words to you now since we are at it. I want you to know that you have treated me <strong>infernal</strong>ly — infernally! And if you think I will sit unrevenged, you are mistaken. Meanwhile, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law’s little secret; I swear I will make the most of it. And better you keep out of my way.”

        “I seek no revenge,” replied Heathcliff. “But you have broken my heart when you were my only <strong>anchor</strong>, and now you are spending your life peacefully. Do you think the good behaviour you give me can rest my soul? I shall have my satisfaction.”
      </p>

      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/33/6.mp3">
        My fears appeared real to me now after the conversation had ended. Catherine sat down by the fire, <strong>blushing</strong> and gloomy.

      He descended and, bidding the servants wait in the passage, went with me to the kitchen. Heathcliff and Catherine were still talking angrily, but on seeing my master, they suddenly stopped. As Mr. Edgar was expressing his indignation, Heathcliff stood eyeing him with contempt. Mr. Edgar signed to me to fetch the men and, as I moved, Catherine suspecting something ran forwards quickly, <strong>slammed</strong> the door and locked it.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/34/2.mp3">
      Edgar tried to take the key from Catherine’s grasp, but she flung it into the fire. Mr. Edgar was taken aback with trembling, and his face grew deadly pale. He could not suppress his emotions, and anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/34/3.mp3">
      He leant on the back of a chair and covered his face with his hand.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/34/4.mp3">
      “I wish you joy with this <strong>milk-blooded</strong> coward, Cathy!” said I. “I would not strike him with my fist. I would kick him with my foot..” Then, he approached and gave the chair on which Mr. Linton rested a push. My master quickly sprang to his feet and struck Heathcliff in the throat, a blow that would have levelled a slighter man. It took Heathcliff’s breath for a minute, and, while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out.

      “Do you think I’m leaving with that blow burning in my throat?” Heathcliff thundered. “By hell, no! I’ll crush his ribs like a rotten hazelnut before I cross the threshold.”

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/34/7.mp3">
      “He is not coming,” I said. “There are the coachman and two gardeners; you will surely not want to be thrown out by them.” Heathcliff <strong>smashed</strong> the lock with the help of the poker and made his escape. This was followed by the hysterical behaviour of Catherine. 
For several days, she shut herself up in her room, refusing to eat or 
drink

      Mr. Linton, too, did not enquire about his wife and spent his time alone in the library. He had an hour of interview with Isabella, at the end of which he concluded if she was so <strong>insane</strong> as to encourage that worthless suitor, all bonds of relationship between her and him would dissolve.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/35/2.mp3">

      On the third day, Catherine opened the door, and I was shocked beyond words by her swollen face and strange exaggerated manner.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/35/4.mp3">
      “Where is Edgar?” she demanded.

      “Among his books!” she cried “When I am dying? Is he so <strong>utterly</strong> indifferent to my life?” She was trembling uncontrollably.

I rushed back into the room and found her staring at the mirror, trembling and bewildered.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/35/7.mp3">

      “She had closed herself here and would not let any of us come to her,” I explained. The master was angry for being kept ignorant of this. He took his wife in his arms and looked at her.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/36/4.mp3">
      At first, she gave him no glance of <strong>recognition</strong>; he was invisible to her <strong>abstracted</strong> gaze. However, in a while, she could fix her attention on him and discovered who it was that held her.

      Dr. Kenneth was just about to leave to see some patient when I encountered him. When I explained Catherine’s conditions, he immediately agreed to come. I took him up to Catherine’s chamber. Catherine lay in troubled sleep, and Mr. Linton had succeeded in soothing her ruffled temper. The doctor, suggesting perfect <strong>tranquillity</strong> for her, took his leave.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/37/2.mp3">
      I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton, and the servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through the house quietly and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other during their work. Everyone was active except Miss Isabella. The servants began to remark how soundly Isabella slept, and her brother, too, asked if she had shown any anxiety for her sister-in-law. Then, suddenly, one of the maids came panting upstairs and cries “Master, Master, Isabella is gone — she is gone; Heathcliff’s ran off with her.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/37/3.mp3">
      “That’s not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising with agitation “Go and find her.” I ran and <strong>peeped</strong> into Isabella’s room, confirming when I returned, the servant’s <strong>statement</strong>.

      For two months, the <strong>fugitives</strong> remained absent. In those months, Catherine, who had brain fever, lay between life and death. No mother could have nursed a child more <strong>devotedly</strong> than Edgar tended her. Day and night he sat there, watching and tending her, caring nothing for his own health. At last, when the doctor announced her life was out of danger, it was as if Edgar was recovering a new life. 
    </p>

        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/38/4.mp3">
      Though the doctor was worried that she might never get back the right balance of her mind, we rejoiced at her recovery, for on her existence depended the life of Edgar’s heir, whose birth was due in a short time.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/38/5.mp3">
      Some six weeks after the flight, Isabella sent a short note to her brother announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. At the bottom was an <strong>obscure</strong> apology and a request for <strong>reconciliation</strong>, but Edgar did not reply to this. Two weeks later, I received a long letter from her which made me sadly aware of the misery she was in. 
    </p>

        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/38/6.mp3">
      As I had 
feared, she had been receiving abuse and ill-treatment at the hands 
of Heathcliff from the moment she stepped into Wuthering Heights. 
She pleaded with me to ask her brother’s forgiveness and come to her 
at the earliest opportunity

        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/38/7.mp3">
      The poor creature understood now that 
she had become a pawn in Heathcliff’s game of revenge. I informed 
Mr. Linton of the state of affairs, but he did nothing. However, he 
allowed me to visit Wuthering Heights.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/38/8.mp3">
      Mr. Edgar’s refusal to be reconciled with his sister had saddened me very much; and all the way from the Grange, I kept thinking 
about how I would put it before Isabella.

      When I reached the Heights, I saw her looking through the window. I entered without knocking. She looked pale and listless, and her dress was dirty and <strong>crumpled</strong>. She came forwards eagerly to greet me and held out her hand for the expected letter.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/39/2.mp3">
      I shook my head, and her lip quivered slightly, and that was all. Upon his enquiry, I told Heathcliff about Cathy’s illness and asked him to stay away from the Grange if he really cared for her to recover.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/39/3.mp3">
      But Heathcliff was <strong>adamant</strong> and kept pressing me for an interview with her, threatening he would manage it himself if I did not cooperate. I tried to dissuade him, saying that meeting her now was only going to increase her distress. In the end, seeing no other way, I agreed to carry a letter from him to Catherine.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/39/4.mp3">
      It was only on the fourth day that I could bring that letter to Mrs. Linton while the family was away to church. She had no wish to read it herself, as she did not know from whom it came. 
    </p>

   <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/39/5.mp3">
    When I said it was from Mr. Heathcliff, she gave a start, and a troubled <strong>gleam</strong> of <strong>recollection</strong> came to her eyes. She lifted the letter, but again let it fall and gazed at me with questioning eyes.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/39/6.mp3">
      “Heathcliff wishes to see you,” I said at last.

      Heathcliff, meanwhile, had begun to doubt my promise as four days had passed without any information, and so he came to the Grange. We heard his footsteps in the hall, and the next moment he was inside. He grasped Catherine in his arms.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/39/8.mp3">
      “Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! How can I bear it,” he cried in despair. His eyes burnt with anguish as he looked upon her face.

      Hearing my master mounting the stairs, cold sweat ran from my forehead. I cried out, and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise. Amid my agitation, I saw Catherine’s arm had fallen relaxed and her head hung down.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/41/2.mp3">
      When Edgar saw Heathcliff, he sprang on him with <strong>astonishment</strong> and rage. But Heathcliff stopped him and said “Look here. If you are a friend, help her first — then you shall speak to me!!”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/41/3.mp3">
      Heathcliff walked into the <strong>parlour</strong> and sat down. With great difficulty, Mr. Linton and I managed to restore her to sensation. But she was bewildered, looking around absently, and then she sighed. Edgar in his anxiety forgot Heathcliff, but I did not. I went to him at the earliest opportunity and asked him to depart, which he did.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/41/4.mp3">
      About midnight that night, Cathy whom you saw at Wuthering Heights, was born, and two hours after, her mother died. With the birth of a girl, Edgar was left without an heir; all his property would now pass to his sister Isabella.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/41/5.mp3">
      Six months after Catherine’s death, her brother Hindley also died. His self-destructive ways were too much for him to last long.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/41/6.mp3">
      The death of Catherine had <strong>unleashed</strong> all that was animal and <strong>savage</strong> in Heathcliff. He now wished to take revenge from all whom he blamed for his separation from Catherine. Isabella fell victim to this, as she was too helpless to resist him. 
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/41/7.mp3">
 When his abuse and 
ill-treatment had become unbearable for her, she ran away one 
day, never to return. Before that, she came to me and told me the 
atrocities Heathcliff had regularly inflicted on her.

    She had settled somewhere near London, where her son Linton was born a few months after her escape. Though Heathcliff had discovered both her residence and the existence of the child, he did not try to contact her.

      When Hindley died, his son Hareton should have inherited his father’s estate, but alas the devil had played his game.

      Forgiveness & Death
    </h3>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/44/3.mp3">
      The next twelve years were the happiest of my life. I was the nurse and mother to baby Catherine, and except for <strong>trifling</strong> illnesses, she had a wonderful <strong>constitution</strong>. She grew into a real beauty. She had inherited Mr. Earnshaw’s handsome dark eyes and Mr. Linton’s fair skin and small features. Her spirit was high, her anger was never furious and her love, never fierce. Edgar took on her education entirely himself, as he was pleased to find that she had curiosity and a quick intellect. She learnt rapidly and eagerly, and this made her an <strong>apt</strong> scholar.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/44/4.mp3">
      Till the age of thirteen, Catherine had not once been beyond the range of Thrushcross Park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her out sometimes to a mile or so, but he trusted her to no one else. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her. 
    </p>

        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/44/5.mp3">
      Sometimes, she would make a wish to see what was on the other 
side of the hills, but Mr. Linton would dissuade her by saying not 
until she had grown up.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/44/6.mp3">
      One day, Mr. Edgar received a letter from his sister Isabella. She was on her deathbed and had <strong>entreated</strong> her brother to forgive her and come so she could place her son Linton in his hands safely and die in peace. 
    </p>
    
      <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/44/7.mp3">
     My master was grieved beyond words to know this 
and immediately left for London, putting Catherine under my charge 
with repeated instructions that she was not to wander out of the 
park at any cost.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/1.mp3">
      One morning, Catherine mounted her horse and trotted off laughing. Only that day, she did not return.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/2.mp3">
      In a panic, I sent servants in all directions, and I went out to search for her. As I came across a labourer on the way, I inquired if he had seen our young lady. He told me that he had seen her cross the hill. 
    </p>
   <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/3.mp3">
      You may guess how I felt on hearing this news. I, fearing where she may have gone to, walked mile after mile until a turn brought me in sight of the Heights, but no Catherine could I see, far or near. My <strong>suspense</strong> was truly painful. I ran to the door and knocked <strong>vehemently</strong>. 
    </p>  


    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/4.mp3">
     A woman opened the door, and, upon entering, I saw Catherine seated on the hearth, rocking herself in a little chair which had been her mother’s. Like a child, she was laughing and chattering to Hareton, now a fine lad of eighteen, who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/5.mp3">
      “Very well, Miss!” I exclaimed in an angry tone, hiding my joy at finding her “This was your last ride until Papa comes back. I will not trust you over the <strong>threshold</strong> again, you naughty, naughty girl!”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/6.mp3">
      “Ah, Ellen!” she cried happily “I shall have a pretty story to tell tonight, and so you have found me out. Have you ever been here in your life before?”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/7.mp3">
      “Put your hat on, and come home at once,” I said “I’m dreadfully grieved at you. To think how your father had trusted me to keep you in and you strayed off so. Nobody will put faith in you any more.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/8.mp3">
      But it was only in the afternoon, and after much <strong>persuasion</strong>, that I could make her mount her pony to return.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/45/9.mp3">
      However, she had discovered that Hareton was her cousin, and due to her father’s dislike for the people at the Heights, she had been kept ignorant of it until now.

   Miss Cathy was repulsed by the idea of Hareton being her cousin, as he looked no better than a farmhand.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/46/2.mp3">
      Heathcliff seemed to have bent his wickedness on making him a <strong>brute</strong>. Hareton was never taught to read or write, never <strong>rebuked</strong> for any bad habit, never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single rule against <strong>vice</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/46/3.mp3">
      On our way back, Hareton came to show the way, and Catherine told him who she was and where she was going. He seemed fond of his cousin, except when she addressed him as a servant. I told Cathy not to tell of this visit to her father, as it would anger him very much.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/46/4.mp3">
      A letter soon arrived announcing my master’s return. Isabella was dead, and he had written to me to make the necessary preparation for the young nephew he was bringing with him. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of receiving her cousin, Linton. When Mr. Edgar arrived and was greeting his daughter, I peeked in to see Linton as he lay asleep, wrapped in a cloak. 
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/46/5.mp3">
      He was a pale, delicate boy with a sickly <strong>peevishness</strong> in his aspect, which Edgar Linton never had.
  Cathy was overjoyed to have found a real cousin, but it was short-lived as that very night, Joseph arrived from the Heights to take 
Linton back as was Heathcliff’s wish.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/46/6.mp3">
      My master grieved bitterly at 
the idea of sending the child to Heathcliff, but there was nothing 
that could prevent it. He told Joseph that the child was tired from 
a long journey, and he would be sending him over tomorrow
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/46/7.mp3">
      Mr. Linton commissioned me to take Linton to the Heights early the next morning. I was told not to say anything to Cathy, as then she would be anxious to visit her there, which Edgar never wanted.
    </p>

 “Hello, Nelly!” said Mr. Heathcliff “So you have brought my property, haven’t you? Let us see what we can make of it.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/2.mp3">
      Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three. Heathcliff, having stared hard at his son, uttered a scornful laugh.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/3.mp3">
      “God! What a beauty! What a lovely, charming thing!” he exclaimed “Oh, my damn soul! It’s worse than I expected.”

      The bewildered and trembling child clung to me with fear, and when Heathcliff bade him come, he hid his face on my shoulder and started crying.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/5.mp3">
      “Tut, tut!” said Heathcliff, stretching out his hand and dragging him roughly between his knees “Nelly, if you are tired, you may sit down. If not, get home again.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/6.mp3">
      “Well,” I replied “I hope you will be kind to that boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you will not keep him long, and he is all you have in this wide world.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/7.mp3">
      “I will be very kind to him; you need not fear,” he said, laughing. He sent Joseph and Hareton about their jobs and then resumed “Yes, Nelly,” he said “My son is the <strong>prospective</strong> owner of your place, and I want him stay well until he acquires it for me. 
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/8.mp3">

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/9.mp3">
      Having no excuse for <strong>lingering</strong> any longer, I slipped out. As I closed the door, a cry, a frantic repetition of the words:

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/47/10.mp3">
      “Don’t tease me. I will not stay here! I will not stay here!” was heard. Then, the latch was raised, and then it fell.

      Catherine did not see her cousin again for a long time, and before she did, his features had become so dim in her memory that she could not recognise him. However, I used to ask the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, whenever I chanced to encounter him, how Linton was getting on.

                My aunt’s maid walked out of the shop, telling me to follow her.
                We arrived at a neat cottage with a small garden, full of
                flowers. “This is Miss Trotwood’s house,” said the maid. I
                looked down at myself. My shoes were in very bad condition, I
                had no jacket or waistcoat and my hat was
                <strong>crushed</strong> and bent. My shirt and trousers were
                dirty and worn. I felt very nervous as I waited to introduce
                myself to my aunt.

                My aunt came out of the house wearing gardening gloves and
                waving a large knife in one hand. “Go away,” she cried. “Go
                away! No boys here.” I held my hat in my hand. “Please, madam,”
                I began. “Please, aunt.” Miss Trotwood looked up in surprise.

                “I am your nephew,” I stammered. My aunt sat down on the garden
                path in shock. “I am David Copperfield of Blunderstone in
                Suffolk. You came there the night I was born and saw my mother.
                I have been very unhappy since she died. I have been neglected
                and sent out to work. I have only a little education and I have
                run away to you. I was <strong>robbed</strong> and have walked
                the entire way. I haven’t slept in a bed since I began my

                My aunt got up quickly and took me into her house. She put me on
                her sofa with a shawl under my head and a handkerchief under my
                feet to keep it clean. She then rang the bell and called for
                Janet, the serving girl. “Go upstairs and ask Mr. Dick to come

                A grey-haired, pleasant-looking man entered the room. “Mr.

                “Yes, you are right,” agreed my aunt. She called for Janet to
                run me a bath. The bath was a great comfort and while I was
                bathing, my aunt found me a pair of trousers and a shirt
                belonging to Mr. Dick. When I was clean and dressed, I lay down
                on the sofa and fell asleep. When I woke up, I looked around the
                neat room. We sat down to an excellent dinner and all the time I
                was worrying about what my aunt was going to do with me.

                After dinner I told my aunt and Mr. Dick my story. They asked me
                a lot of questions, which I answered as
                <strong>truthfully</strong> as I could. My aunt was very upset
                to hear that my mother had married again and called my
                stepfather a murderer.

                When I finished telling my tale, my aunt turned to Mr. Dick and
                said, “Now, Mr. Dick. I am going to ask you another question.
                Look at this child. What would you do with him now?”

                So I was taken to bed. I noticed that there were no clothes in
                the room and as I said goodnight and climbed into bed, I thought
                that my aunt might think that I would run away again. My room
                was at the top of the house overlooking the sea and as I drifted
                off to sleep, I thought of all the lonely nights I had spent
                under the stars. I prayed that I might never be
                <strong>homeless</strong> again.

                After a while we stopped in front of a very old house. A thin,
                bony face appeared at a small window on the ground floor and
                quickly disappeared again. It belonged to a red-haired boy of
                about fifteen, I noticed he had no eyelashes and that his eyes

                Mr. Wickfield knocked on a door. A young girl of about my own
                age came out and kissed the old man. This was his daughter,

                Doctor Strong’s was an excellent school. It was very different
                from Mr. Creakle’s school as there was order, discipline and
                cleanliness everywhere. Dr. Strong and the other teachers
                expected the boys to be polite at all times and rarely did we
                disgrace ourselves by our manners or our appearances. Dr. Strong

                My aunt came to visit me at Canterbury on several occasions and
                Mr. Dick came every Wednesday, arriving by stagecoach at noon
                and staying over until the next morning. Mr. Dick really enjoyed
                these Wednesdays and he soon became known to every boy in the
                school.

                Uriah reminded me of the invitation to visit his home and I told
                him that I was waiting to be asked. “Oh, if that’s all, Master
                Copperfield,” he said, “and it really isn’t our humbleness that
                stops you from coming, will you come this evening?”

                I said that I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield and if he
                approved then I would go with pleasure. “Have you been studying
                much law lately?” I asked him. “Oh, Master Copperfield,” he
                said. “My reading is hardly to be called study. Anyway, there
                are a lot of Latin words that are too difficult for a humble man
                to understand.”
              </p>

                I offered to teach him Latin.

                “Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,” he answered, shaking his
                head. “It’s very kind of you to make the offer, but I am much
                too humble to accept it.”

                I told him that he was wrong and that I could help him. “Here is
                my humble home, Master Copperfield,” he said. We entered a low,
                old-fashioned room straight from the street. Mrs. Heap looked
                exactly like Uriah, only shorter.
              </p>

                “This is a day to be remembered Uriah,” she said to her son.
                “Master Copperfield has been kind enough to pay us a visit. My
                Uriah has looked forward to this visit. He was worried that our
                humbleness would stop you. Humble we are, humble we have been
                and humble we shall ever be.”

                “I am sure you have no reason to be so, madam,” I replied. I was
                embarrassed by these compliments. I ate well and afterwards we
                talked about aunts. I told them about mine and about my father
                and mother. I wanted the visit to be over, but suddenly, a
                figure walked along the street, passed the open door, came back,
                walked in, and shouted loudly, “Copperfield! Is it possible?”

                It was Mr. Micawber! We shook hands and I asked after Mrs.
                Micawber and the children. Mr. Micawber said that she was well
                and would be <strong>delighted</strong> to see me. I told him
                that I would be happy to see her too. I had no choice but to
                introduce Mr. Micawber to Uriah and his mother, after which I
                <strong>hustled</strong> Mr. Micawber out of the door.

                Mrs. Micawber was surprised to see me and we greeted each other
                warmly. I stayed a little while and left after accepting an
                invitation to dinner with them the following evening.

                The next day I was looking out of my window and saw, to my
                surprise, Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walking past, arm in arm.
                That night during dinner, Mr. Micawber turned to me and said, “I
                have to tell you, young Copperfield, your friend Heep is a
                talented man and will go far in this world!”

                I was surprised at this relationship between Micawber and Heep.
                I had a very pleasant dinner with the Micawbers. Afterwards,
                Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch. After the punch we
                were all very merry and sang “Auld Lang Syne” and I left the
                Micawbers feeling very happy.

                Because of this, I was totally unprepared at seven o’clock the
                next morning to receive a desperate letter from Mr. Micawber,
                dated half past nine at night, just a few minutes after I had
                left him.

                would never hear from them again.

                London coach leaving with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in it. They were
                smiling at each other and eating walnuts. I was pleased to see
                them looking so happy and although I liked them a lot, I was

                Time passed and my school days came to an end. I was sorry to
                leave, as I had a good relationship with Dr. Strong and I
                enjoyed my time at school. I had discussed my future with my
                aunt for the past year or so but did not know what I wanted to
                do with the rest of my life.

                One morning during the Christmas season my aunt said to me,
                “Trot, my dear, a change of <strong>scenery</strong> will do you
                good. It might help you make up your mind about what you are
                going to do with your life. Why don’t you go down to Yarmouth
                and visit Peggotty?”

                I agreed and my aunt suggested that I spend a few days in London
                before travelling to Yarmouth. She said that I could stay away
                as long as I liked so long as I wrote to her three times a week
                to let her know that I was well. I agreed to this condition
                happily.

                I went to say goodbye to Agnes and Mr. Wickfield. Agnes was
                delighted to see me, but after the hugging and greetings were
                done she said, “Trotwood, there is something I would like to ask
                you. You know my father as well; do you think he has changed in
                any way?”

                I had noticed some changes in him and Agnes asked me to explain,
                “His hand trembles, his speech is <strong>slurred</strong> and
                his eyes look wild. His drinking habit has become worse and he
                is unable to work. This makes him so worried that the next day
                he begins drinking again,” I said. “He does not seem to be able
                to snap out of it.”

                We shook hands, hugged and cried for joy. “Steerforth, I am so

                “I’m very happy to see you too!” said Steerforth. We sat down
                and told each other what we had been up to since I had left
                Salem House.

                Steerforth was now studying at Oxford University and was on his
                way to visit his mother. On learning that I had no definite
                plans, he invited me to spend a few days with him. I agreed
                happily and wrote a letter to my aunt, explaining that I was
                going to spend a few days with Steerforth before visiting
                Peggotty in Yarmouth.

                The next morning Steerforth met me at my hotel and
                <strong>bundled</strong> me into a stagecoach. We drove to an
                old brick house on the top of a hill at Highgate. As we climbed
                down from the stagecoach, an attractive lady walked towards us.
                “My dearest James,” she said, hugging Steerforth. I was
                introduced to Mrs. Steerforth and she welcomed me with open
                arms.

                There was a second lady in the dining room, Miss Rosa Dartle,
                who was Mrs. Steerforth’s companion. This lady was about thirty
                years old, very thin with black hair and black eyes. I stayed
                with Steerforth for a week. Steerforth gave me lessons in
                riding, fencing and boxing, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.
                At the end of the week we said goodbye to Mrs. Steerforth and
                Miss Dartle and took the train to Yarmouth.

                Steerforth said he would follow a little later. She was in the
                kitchen cooking dinner when I arrived. She opened the door as
                soon as I knocked and asked me politely what I wanted. “Is Mr.
                Barkis at home, madam?” I teased. Peggotty said that he was but

                I asked if Mr. Barkis ever went to Blunderstone and she looked
                at me and smiled. “My darling boy!” she said, throwing her arms
                around me, tears running down her face. “Barkis will be so glad
                to see you,” she cried, wiping her tears on her apron. “Your
                visit will do him more good than any medicine.”

                we spoke of old times. I told Peggotty that Steerforth was with
                me. Not long after which he knocked on the door. Steerforth and
                I ate dinner with Peggotty and afterwards Steerforth got up to
                leave.

                I spent the night at Peggotty’s and the following evening we set
                out for Mr. Peggotty’s boathouse. I was anxious to show
                Steerforth the house that I had talked so much about.

                “Dismal enough in the dark,” he replied, “and the sea roars as
                if it were hungry for us. Is that the boat I can see up in

                I agreed that it was. We spoke no more until I had my hand on
                the latch of the door. I whispered to Steerforth to keep close
                behind me as I pushed the door open. We entered quietly and
                there they all were! Mr. Peggotty was laughing happily and
                holding Emily in his arms. Ham I stood looking proud and holding
                Emily’s hand. Emily stood laughing prettily, blushing and
                smiling. She was <strong>squeezing</strong> Ham’s hand when I
                turned and saw us, shouting, “Master Davy! It’s Master Davy!”

                Steerforth and I congratulated the happy couple warmly and spent
                a very pleasant evening <strong>chatting</strong> about old
                times and the young couple’s future. It was almost midnight when
                we left. “Emily is a very beautiful girl,” said Steerforth as we

                <strong>fiancé</strong> is.”

                Steerforth and I stayed in Yarmouth for more than a fortnight.
                We spent time together as well as time apart. Steerforth often
                went sailing with Mr. Peggotty whilst I remained
                <strong>ashore</strong>. There were three or four days when we
                parted after an early breakfast and met up later for dinner. I
                do not know what he did on those days although I did find out
                that he was very popular with everyone in the area.

                One evening I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty’s house sitting in
                front of the fire. He jumped up when I put my hand on his
                shoulder and said angrily, “You frightened me. I didn’t hear you
                come in,” I apologised and was relieved to see him smile and
                hear him say, “So, we leave this carefree life tomorrow?”

                I agreed that we will, and that I had already booked our places
                on the coach. Steerforth looked unhappy and I remarked on it.

                “Did you know I had bought a boat?” he asked. “A clipper ship.

                I was stunned at this news and <strong>exclaimed</strong>, “You
                are very strange, Steerforth! You pretend to have bought it for
                yourself, but you may never come near the place again. You

                Steerforth ignored this remark and carried on, “There is a lot
                of work to be done on the boat, so I am leaving Littimer behind
                to oversee it. Did I tell you that he came down from Highgate
                this morning?” Littimer was Steerforth’s servant. He was a quiet
                man, always polite but somehow <strong>secretive</strong>. I did
                not like or trust him.

                her,” said Steerforth. “Oh, what are you going to call her?” I
                asked.

                “The Little Emily,” replied Steerforth. “Oh, but look, here
                comes the real Emily, and Ham is with her. He is always with
                her. What is he frightened of? Does he think she will run away?”

                Ham was very <strong>protective</strong> of the pretty Emily and
                put his arm around her as they got closer to us. She shook hands
                with both Steerforth and myself and then after a few words they
                walked on together.

                At breakfast, I received a letter from my aunt and decided to
                discuss it with Steerforth on the coach. We said our goodbyes to
                Mr. and Mrs. Barkis and to Mr. Peggotty, Ham and Emily. Littimer
                was staying behind until the work on the boat was finished.

                On the coach, Steerforth was quieter than usual, but then turned
                to me and asked, “What about that letter you were speaking about
                at breakfast, David?”

                “Oh,” I said, taking it out of my pocket, “It’s from my aunt.
                She reminds me that I came on this trip to think about my future
                and to decide on a career. To tell you the truth, I forgot all

                “Yes, she does. She asks me if I want to be a proctor. What is a
                proctor, Steerforth?” “A proctor is a sort of lawyer,” replied
                Steerforth.

                “But advocates and proctors are not one and the same, are they?”
                I asked, puzzled. “No,” replied Steerforth. “Advocates are men
                who have taken a doctor’s degree at college. Proctors employ
                advocates and they both are paid very well. I would recommend

                I made up my mind to do so and decided to travel to town where

                <strong>embraced</strong> as if we had been apart for many
                years. After supper, my aunt and I sat down to talk. “Well,
                Trot,” she began. “What do you think about the proctor plan or
                not?” haven’t you had time to make up your mind yet?”

                My room was at the top of the house. I was well-looked after by
                Mrs. Crupp, the landlady, and after few days and nights I felt
                as if I had lived there for a year. Steerforth had not turned up
                as we had arranged, so I walked to Highgate and saw Mrs.
                Steerforth. She told me that her son had gone away with one of
                his Oxford friends and was due to return the following day.

                A few days later, I was having my coffee and roll in the morning
                before going to the office, when Steerforth walked in.
                “Steerforth,” I cried. “I was beginning to think I would never
                see you again!” We agreed that he and two friends would join me

                They arrived promptly at six o’clock and I asked Steerforth to
                be in charge over the table, as I was inexperienced in such
                matters. Mrs. Crupp had hired a young man to serve the meal.
                After dinner, we went to the theatre. Due to the large amount of
                wine I had drunk I behaved badly, especially when I saw Agnes. I
                called to her during the <strong>performance</strong> and was
                told to be quiet by everyone around me. Agnes was very
                embarrassed and asked my friends to take me home.

                see her. I went at once and apologized for my behaviour the
                night before. “It’s over, Trotwood,” she said. “Forget about it.

                Agnes reminded me of our previous conversation about her father
                and said that Uriah had made himself
                <strong>indispensable</strong>. Agnes then said that she thought
                her father was afraid of Uriah Heep. “Uriah professes humility
                and gratitude, but his position is one of power. He said that he
                was going away because he had found a job with better
                <strong>prospects</strong>. My father was very upset by this
                news and offered him a partnership.”

                The weeks passed and my training was complete. I was then
                articled at Spenlow and Jorkins at a salary of ninety pounds a
                year. I looked forward to my future as a lawyer. Mr. Spenlow
                invited me to spend a weekend at his house in Norwood with him
                and his daughter. She had just finished her education in Paris
                and had returned to England.

                laugh. Later that evening, Miss Murdstone stepped me and spoke
                to me about the past. She tried to excuse herself for the way
                she and her brother had treated me, but I turned to her and
                said, “Miss Murdstone, you and Mr. Murdstone were cruel to me.
                You treated my mother very unkindly and I will never forgive you
                for that as long as I live. I would prefer not to talk about the

                I said that I hadn’t and before I could say anything else, Miss
                Murdstone found us and marched us into breakfast. Dora made the
                tea and I drank cup after cup, just because she had made it. We
                spent a quiet day walking together and dining with the family.
                In the evening we looked through books and pictures. Miss

                punch, as that was his specialty. The three of them arrived on
                time and were delighted at my home. Mr. Micawber happily peeled

                As I was undressing for bed, a letter from Mr. Micawber
                <strong>tumbled</strong> to the floor. It was dated an hour and
                a half before dinner. Mr. Micawber was once again in crisis and
                behind with the rent. I did not feel sorry for Mr. Micawber, but
                I did feel sorry for Traddles, as Mr. Micawber had sold
                Traddles’ possessions as well as his own to
                <strong>pay off</strong> his debts. This would put back my
                friend’s wedding. I wondered if the curate’s daughter would wait
                forever.

                I arrived in Yarmouth in the evening and went to the inn, and
                then went to visit Mr. Peggotty. He opened the door at the first
                step and we shook hands with and thanked him for coming. Emily
                was sitting by the fire with her hands in front of her face and
                Ham was standing next to her.

                “Emily, my dear, here’s Master Davy!” cried Mr. Peggotty. Emily
                trembled and I remember the coldness of her hand when I touched
                it. Peggotty came alone and hugged me and thanked me for coming.
                She led me upstairs to see her husband.

                “Barkis, my dear!” she said, bending over him. “Here’s my dear
                boy Master Davy, who brought us together, Barkis! Won’t you
                speak to Master Davy?” Peggotty spoke to him again and he opened
                his eyes. He tried to stretch out his arm and said to me with a
                pleasant smile, “Barkis is willing.” Then he died.

                I stayed with Peggotty until the funeral was over. She decided
                to return to London with me so that I could execute Mr. Barkis’s
                will. We looked for the will in the box he kept under the bed,
                but after quite a long search it was found at the bottom of the
                horse’s nosebags together with an old gold watch with chain and
                seals, eighty-seven guineas and a half in guineas and
                half-guineas, two hundred and ten pounds in bank notes, receipts
                for Bank of England stock and an old horseshoe. Altogether, Mr.
                Barkis had been worth over three thousand pounds. He left some
                money to Mr. Peggotty, to Ham, to little Emily and to myself,
                but most of it went to his widow.

                The night before Peggotty and I left for London, Ham arrived wet
                and <strong>dripping</strong> on the doorstep. In answer to Mr.
                Peggotty’s question of Emily’s whereabouts, Ham made a motion
                with his head, as if she were outside. Ham asked to speak to me
                outside. He looked pale and I asked him what the matter was.

                I saw the door move. It was too late. I shall never forget the
                look on Mr. Peggotty’s face when he saw us. We all stood in the
                kitchen. Ham handed me a letter from Emily and I looked at it.

                I started reading it slowly. “When you — who love me so much
                more than I deserve — read this, I shall be far away. I am
                leaving my home, never to return unless he marries me and brings

                thanks are for my uncle.” That was all it said. Mr. Peggotty
                stood still long after I finished reading. Then he said in a
                low, quiet voice, “Who’s the man? I want to know his name.”

                thought he had left town, but he was hiding. A strange carriage

                Mrs. Steerforth said that her son was an honourable man, but
                that he would never marry Emily because the girl was far below
                him in status.

                Later that day Mr. Spenlow told me that it was Dora’s birthday

                When I arrived for the celebration, Dora was sitting in the
                garden looking beautiful in a white bonnet and a blue dress. A
                young lady called Julia Mills was also there, playing with
                Dora’s dog, Jip. Dora thanked me for the flowers and held them

                her brother’s wedding and will be away at least three weeks.

                I agreed with her and helped Dora up off the ground and

                to the top of a hill, where more friends were waiting for us. We
                had a wonderful time and after lunch Dora and I walked among the
                shady trees holding hands. No words can describe the feelings I
                had that day.

                As we were leaving, Miss Mills explained that Dora was going to
                stay with her for a few days and that she would be happy if I
                visited them.

                The next three days were torture for me, trying to imagine what
                Dora would say to my marriage proposal. I arrived outside Miss
                Mills’ house and walked up and down the street, too nervous to
                knock at the door. When I at last managed to approach the front
                door, I was quickly let in and shown to an upstairs room where
                Miss Mills was copying music and Dora was painting flowers.

                idolized and worshipped her and each time I spoke, Jip barked
                loudly. Dora hung her head and cried but very soon we were
                sitting side by side on the sofa. Dora and I were engaged! It

                We decided to keep our love a secret from Mr. Spenlow for the

                in keeping a secret from my fiancée’s father. I measured Dora’s

                My aunt went on to say that she was mined financially. “All I
                have "In the world is in this room, except for the cottage which
                I have rented out to holidaymakers. Mrs. Barkis, could you help
                me find a bed for Mr. Dick tonight? To save on expense I will
                sleep here tonight, only for tonight and we can talk about the

                My aunt hugged me and kissed me and said, "We must be brave,
                Trot. We must face our problems with courage." That night I gave
                my aunt my bed and I slept in the sitting room. Before bed, we
                talked about my love for Dora and our secret engagement.

                The next morning, I was at the office bright and early waiting
                for Mr. Spenlow to appear with the key. "How are you,
                Copperfield?" he asked. "It's a lovely morning! What are you
                doing here so early?"

                "It's a beautiful morning sir," I replied. "Could I have a word

                He invited me to his room and I told him about my aunt's loss of
                money. I asked him to return the thousand pounds given for my
                training, so that I could give the money to my aunt. Mr. Spenlow
                said that if it were up to him that it would be done
                immediately, but that his partner, Mr. Jorkins, would never
                agree to it. I asked for permission to speak to Mr. Jorkins
                myself, which Mr. Spenlow <strong>granted</strong>. I went to
                see Mr. Jorkins and told him the story. "I am sorry, Mr.
                Copperfield but I cannot return your money," said Mr. Jorkins
                and then he hurriedly left the office for an appointment at the
                bank.

                Knowing that I could not return my aunt’s money to her depressed
                me and I walked home. My depression lifted when I found Agnes
                waiting for me. We hugged and she told me that she had come to
                London to see my aunt. They were very fond of each other, even
                though there was a great difference in their ages.

                I could not believe my ears when Agnes explained that Uriah Heep
                was now her father’s partner. “My father and Uriah have some
                business here, so I came with them. I do not like my father
                spending too much time alone with Uriah.”

                “Even more,” agreed Agnes sadly. “Uriah and his mother live with
                us now. He sleeps in your old room.” I was very upset by this
                news but didn’t know what I could do to help. We joined my aunt
                and I told them what I had tried to do that morning.

                “That was a silly thing to do,” said my aunt, “but you meant
                well. You are a kind boy and I am proud of you.”

                We discussed my aunt’s unwise investments and how she came to
                lose all of her money. Agnes thought that I might learn more
                about the matter if I became secretary to Dr. Strong. “Doctor
                Strong is <strong>retiring</strong> and has come to live in
                London,” said Agnes, “and he has asked my father to recommend
                someone who could work as a secretary. Don’t you think he would
                rather have his favourite old pupil near him, rather than a
                complete stranger?”

                It was an excellent suggestion and I
                <strong>contacted</strong> Dr. Strong immediately. He was very
                happy to see me and we agreed that I would work for him for two
                hours every morning and two hours every evening except for
                Saturdays and Sundays and that he would pay me seventy pounds a
                year.

                I was very busy, getting up at five in the morning and not
                returning home until nine or ten at night. I did not tell Dora
                any of this in the letters I sent to her in secret. I did not
                want her to worry about me.

                My aunt and I went to visit Mr. Wickfield at his office. Uriah
                Heep was <strong>hovering</strong> nearby. I had not seen Mr.
                Wickfield for a long time and I was shocked by his appearance.
                He looked much older, his eyes were bloodshot and his hands were
                trembling. His good looks had gone and he walked and spoke like
                an old man. Uriah Heep seemed to hold a great power over Mr.
                Wickfield although I did not know why.

                Agnes softly spoke to her father, "Father, Miss Trotwood and
                Trotwood are here. You haven’t seen them for a long time." He
                shook hands with my aunt and myself.

                “Well, Wickfield,” said my aunt, “I have been telling your
                daughter how well I have been looking after my money myself,
                because I couldn’t trust it to you, as you have invested my
                money <strong>unwisely</strong>. In my opinion, Agnes is worth
                more than the whole firm and she should run this business for

                “If I may humbly speak,” muttered Uriah Heep, “I fully agree
                with Miss Trotwood and should be only too happy if Miss Agnes
                was a partner in this firm.” He turned to me, “Mister
                Copperfield, I hope I see you well. I am happy to see you, even
                under these <strong>circumstances</strong>.” He shook hands with
                me and said: “How do you think we are looking, Master
                Copperfield—I should say, Mister! Don’t you find Mr. Wickfield
                in good health, sir?”

                “Uriah Heep,” said Mr. Wickfield, in a monotonous voice, “is
                active in the business, Trotwood. I trust him in all business
                matters. Uriah Heep is a great help to me.”

                Smiling at these words of praise, Uriah Heep left for another
                appointment and those of us remaining sat and talked of
                pleasanter things. Without Uriah Heep watching him, Mr.
                Wickfield became more like his former self and agreed that it
                was just like old times.

                Dora did not believe me until she saw my serious face. Then she
                began to cry. I fell on my knees and begged her not to cry. When
                the sobbing had stopped, I told her that I really was a poor man
                and explained how it had happened. I told her I was not afraid
                of hard work, and how I was also working for Doctor Strong. I
                said that I hoped she would not mind being married to a poor man
                and that I would work very hard to make her happy. I drew a
                sketch of the little cottage I had seen at Highgate, where I
                wanted us to live after we were married.

                I explained my aunt’s situation but Dora did not seem very happy
                about my aunt living with us in our little cottage. She was also
                unhappy when I suggested that she learn how to cook and keep
                accounts. I was relieved when Julia Mills walked into the room
                and we could stop talking about our future.

                One day, when I went to the office, I found Mr. Spenlow in the
                doorway looking very serious. He did not answer my greeting and
                coldly requested me to go with him to a coffeehouse down the

                The room began to spin and I thought I was going to faint. One
                of the clerks sat me down in a chair and brought me some water
                and loosened my tie. I asked what had happened and how Mr.

                horse and carriage arrived home without him. He had been driving
                himself, as he does sometimes. The servants went to look for him

                The clerk went on to tell me that Mr. Spenlow was badly in debt
                and that once all his debts had been paid there would only be a
                thousand pounds left for his daughter. I was very worried about
                Dora, who was now an orphan. I received a letter from Julia
                Mills telling me that Dora was going to stay with her two aunts
                in Putney. This made me feel better, knowing that Dora was not
                on her own.

                Canterbury to see Agnes. I found Mr. Micawber sitting where
                Uriah Heep used to sit. He seemed very happy to see me, but
                appeared a little confused as well. He told me that he and Mrs.
                Micawber were staying at Uriah Heep’s old house and that his

                I was very disturbed by this news and stopped by Agnes’s room
                where she was writing at her desk. I told her that I had missed
                her and then went on to tell her everything that had happened
                between Mr. Spenlow and myself and of his sudden death. Agnes

                I went downstairs to visit Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep. Mr.

                office looked newly painted and fresh. They greeted me both in
                their own way. Mr. Wickfield looked at me with pleasure and
                said, “Please stay with us Trotwood, while you are in

                I asked if there was room for me and Uriah said that they would
                be happy to have me there. He said that I could sleep in my old
                room but I offered to sleep in another room, not wanting to
                upset the domestic arrangements of the house.

                All the time I stayed with the Wickfields, Uriah Heep did not
                leave me alone with Agnes and Mr. Wickfield for one minute. If
                he left the room, then his mother was there. By the second
                evening, I was so fed up with their company that I went for a
                walk by myself. I had not walked far when Uriah shambled up
                behind me. I stopped to speak to him. “How fast you walk,” he
                exclaimed. “My legs are very long, but I’ve had a job to keep up
                with you.

                I grew angry at his words and shouted, “Do you think I regard
                Miss Wickfield as anything but a very dear friend? I am engaged
                to another lady. Before we leave the subject I want you to know

                After dinner, Mr. Wickfield drank far too much at Uriah Heep’s

                Mr. Wickfield got up from the table and gave a cry of horror.
                “What’s the matter?” asked Uriah. “I have as much right as any

                On my way home I bumped into Mr. Peggotty. Mr. Peggotty told me

                far. He said that he had been as far as France, but there was no
                sign of his niece. In the end, Mr. Peggotty had returned to
                England where he found that not only had Emily written to him
                but had also sent him a fifty-pound bank note.

                The next letter he received contained a five-pound bank note and

                letter had been posted in Germany and that’s where Mr. Peggotty
                was going to find his little Emily.

                If I can do that and find my Emily, then I’ll be a happy man.”

                Just a few days after seeing Mr. Peggotty, I received a letter
                from Dora’s aunts inviting me to visit. I was so nervous that I
                took Traddles with me. We presented ourselves at the appointed
                time and were shown into the drawing room where I found two
                little ladies, dressed in black.

                They asked me to sit down which I did after I had introduced
                Traddles. I was nervous and uncomfortable under the stares of
                Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa Spenlow. “You ask permission of
                my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield, to visit our
                niece,” stated Miss Lavinia.
              </p>

                I nodded and stammered my agreement. Miss Lavinia continued,
                “Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been careful
                indeed in considering this. No doubt you think you like her very
                much.”

                I was about to interrupt the lady but stopped as soon as
                Traddles spoke up on my behalf, telling the ladies about his own
                engagement to Sophy all the way down in Devonshire.

                Clarissa said, “We shall be happy to receive Mr. Copperfield to
                dinner, every Sunday. We eat at three and during the week we
                shall be happy to sit down to tea with Mr. Copperfield. We eat

                from bobbing up and down. The elderly ladies then took me to see
                my dear, sweet Dora. She looked beautiful in a black dress and
                sobbed and cried her joy at seeing me standing there. After a
                short, but happy visit, Traddles and I walked home in high

                I was very busy now with my work at Mr. Spenlow's office and my
                work for Dr. Strong. My visits with Dora in Putney were very
                difficult, so Miss Lavinia gave me permission to visit every
                Saturday afternoon as well, which made my life much easier. I
                was pleased that Dora's aunts and my own aunt visited each other

                When Agnes came to London on a visit, I took her to meet Dora.
                Dora had been Brightened to meet Agnes, as she believed Agnes to
                be a clever woman. Misses Spenlow invited Agnes to stay for tea,
                and to my delight she even made friends with Jip. My fiancée and

                Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa gave their consent and I was
                going to be married to Dora! The wedding preparations were
                complete and I bought the marriage license. I greeted the
                arriving guests and it was a great pleasure to meet Traddles'
                fiancée, Sophy. She was a lovely girl and Traddles presented her
                with great pride to Dora’s aunts. Many friends arrived for the
                occasion, Agnes and Peggotty among them. Mr. Dick was to give
                Dora away at the altar.

                My aunt, Peggotty and I arrived at the church in an open

                proudly down the aisle with my new wife.

                I can’t remember what I said during my speech at the wedding

                going-away outfit and being ready to begin our new life
                together. There were many tears, hugs and kisses, goodbyes and
                farewells before I drove away with my young wife beside me.

                I don’t think any young couple knew less about keeping house
                than my lovely wife and myself. We had servants, but they seemed
                to know less than we did. Dora could neither cook nor manage the
                house, nor command and control the servants. We muddled along
                quite happily for a while until I became so tired of badly
                cooked meals that I asked my aunt to teach Dora to cook.

                My aunt refused, crying, “Trot, don’t ask me to do that. You
                have chosen your wife for yourself. Enjoy her for the

                Not long after the wedding I invited Traddles to dinner. It was
                then that I realised how little space there seemed to be in our
                cottage. My wife sat prettily at one end of the table and
                everything around her seemed in a jumble. Poor Traddles was so
                jammed with Dora’s flower painting and my writing table that it
                was impossible for him to use a knife and fork. “Plenty of room,
                Copperfield,” cries Traddles when I tried to apologise. “Don’t
                worry about it! I’m fine!”
              </p>

                The meal itself was a disaster. The oysters weren’t open and we
                had no oyster knife to open them. The mutton was
                <strong>raw</strong>, but Traddles ate it anyway. After Traddles
                left, Dora apologised for the disastrous meal and promised to do
                better in future. She said that she was going to be a wonderful
                housekeeper but somehow the household figures would just not add
                up. When I was writing at night, Dora would sit bent over her
                accounts but her sighing disturbed me so that I could not put
                pen to paper. “What’s the matter, Dora?” I asked.

                My wife would look up hopelessly and reply, “They won’t come
                right. They give me a headache and they won’t do anything I
                want!” I would give her a practical demonstration but Dora’s
                attention would wander after just five minutes and I would put
                my pencil down.

                I had been married for about a year when I passed Mrs.
                Steerforth’s house on my way home. A servant came out of the
                house and told me that Miss Dartle would like to speak to me and
                that she was waiting for me in the garden. Our meeting was not a
                happy one and Miss Dartle spoke to me angrily. “Has that girl

                “Yes, from him,” she laughed cruelly. “If she is not found soon,
                she may never be found. She may be dead! Do you want to know

                I answered that I did. She called for Mr. Littimer to join us
                and instructed him to tell me everything that had happened since
                Emily left Yarmouth.

                Mr. Littimer began quietly, “Mr. James and myself have been
                abroad with the young woman ever since she left Yarmouth. We
                have travelled <strong>extensively</strong>. We have been in
                France, Switzerland, Italy, all over the place. Mr. James was
                very fond of the young woman and helped her improve herself in
                her manners, dress and language. The young lady was admired
                wherever she went. Unfortunately, she became restless and
                depressed and Mr. James became very impatient with her. Finally,
                one morning, he left for Naples and told me to tell the young
                woman that he had gone. He said that she should marry a
                respectable person and settle down.”

                Littimer <strong>paused</strong> and could not look me in the
                eye. “It was necessary to restrain her because she took Mr.
                James’ departure very badly and I was worried that she might
                harm herself. Later that night, she climbed out of a small
                window and ran away.”

                “It’s very possible that she may have drowned herself,”
                continued Littimer. “Or maybe the boatmen she used to talk to on
                the beach helped her escape.”

                Time passed and my Dora became unwell. She was always tired and

                The following morning, he came to see me and told me Emily had

                grateful to Martha for looking after his girl and for taking us

                Dora appeared weaker every month that passed. I began to believe

                out and died.

                after all the heartache and sorrow. There was nothing left for
                me in England. Before my ship sailed I decided to go to Yarmouth

                We struggled nearer and nearer to the sea and the wind blew with

                had been able to get through such
                <strong>treacherous</strong> weather and that we had survived

                I watched the crowd and to my surprise saw Ham amongst the
                villagers. I watched as he tied a rope around his waist, and I
                realised he was going into the cruel sea. I ran to him and
                begged him not to risk his life but he shook me off and waded
                into the waves.

                I watched as his body was dashed against the wreckage and as I
                stood mesmerized, the shipwreck sank
                <strong>beneath</strong> the waves and Ham was being carried,
                unconscious, to the shore. Not just unconscious, but dead. I
                would never look into Ham’s smiling face again. I wept then for
                Ham, for myself and for Emily.

                I was in for another shock; not only was Ham dead, but
                Steerforth as well. Steerforth had been on the ship and had
                perished at sea. His body was carried to the inn and I knew that
                I would have to break the news of his death to Mrs. Steerforth.

                I travelled to Highgate but was told that Mrs. Steerforth was an
                invalid. She could not come down the stairs to meet with me, and
                so I was shown to her bedroom. She was not alone. Rosa Dartle
                was also there, looking at me suspiciously. I trembled as I
                tried to speak. Mrs. Steerforth looked at me and asked, “My son
                is ill?” I could only nod my agreement.

                I then explained, as best I could, all that had happened that
                fateful morning. Mrs. Steerforth moaned in pain as she fell back
                in her chair.

                My next painful duty was to <strong>conceal</strong> Ham’s death
                from Mr. Peggotty and Emily so that they left for Australia
                happy in their ignorance. I went in search of Mr. Micawber to
                ask him for his help in keeping this tragic news from the
                Peggotts. Mr. Micawber told me that they were sailing earlier
                than expected—the next day.

                The following day, Peggotty and I went to Gravesend and found
                the ship on the river. Martha told me that she, too, was
                travelling to Australia with Mr. Peggotty and Emily. I turned to
                Mr. Peggotty with love in my heart, “Good luck, you are a good
                man!” I embraced Mr. Peggotty, Emily, Martha and the Micawbers
                and watched the ship sail away, filled with people on their way
                to a new beginning.

                It was not long after that when I left England. I travelled from
                country to country through Switzerland and over the Alps into
                Italy. In my <strong>solitude</strong> I
                <strong>mourned</strong> my wife and cried for her death. I had
                not really kept in touch with those in England, just a few lines
                here and there from different cities. On arriving in different
                countries I found letters that had been forwarded to me.

                I opened and read one from Agnes. I was surprised to find that
                thoughts of Agnes were filling my head and my heart more and
                more often. I read her letter many times and wrote to her before
                I slept that night.

                I continued my travelling and picked up my pen once more and
                began to write. I worked from early in the morning until late at
                night and finally finished a story. I sent it to Traddles and he
                arranged for its publication. With this success I set to work in
                earnest. Not only was I writing well, I was taking exercise,
                feeling fit and healthy.

                Agnes and I wrote regularly and I came to realise that I loved
                her, but I also knew that it was too late. Agnes had her own
                life, one that did not include me.

                After three long years abroad, I returned to England, landing in
                London one autumn evening. I immediately went to see Traddles,
                who was now working as a lawyer. He had finally married his
                pretty Sophy. I found him in his chambers and told the clerk
                that I wished to see him. “Goodness!” cried Traddles, “It’s
                Copperfield!” and rushed into my arms. “How wonderful to see
                you! You have grown so famous. When did you arrive, where have
                you come from? What have you been doing?”

                Traddles did not give me time to answer one question before he
                fired off another. He proudly introduced me to the lovely Sophy
                and I was delighted to see how happy they were. I spent a
                pleasant evening with the Traddles before spending my first
                night back in England at a nearby inn.

                The following morning, I took a coach to Dover to visit my aunt,
                I burst into the parlour where my aunt was drinking tea. She and
                Mr. Dick welcomed me with open arms and I was

                My aunt and I talked long into the night. She gave me news of
                Mr. Peggotty and Emily and of the Micawbers. They were doing
                well in their new country. Mr. Peggotty had become a
                hard-working and <strong>prosperous</strong> farmer and Mr.

                I looked at her and asked if there was anything else I should
                know. She told me about her school and about her life with her
                father. I went for a walk by myself, promising that I would
                return later when Mr. Wickfield was at home.

                On my return to the Wickfield home, I was

                After dinner, Agnes played the piano. I tried to tell Agnes that
                I loved her, but it was impossible.

                I returned to Dover and stayed with my aunt while I finished my
                book. I had been in England for two months and it was around
                Christmas time. I had visited Agnes regularly, but she had said
                nothing of a new friend and my hopes had begun to rise. I
                decided to go and visit her one cold and
                <strong>frosty</strong> morning.

                Before I left, my aunt told me that she thought that Agnes was
                seeing a young man and that she also thought that Agnes was to
                be married.

                I was sad and deep in thought as I rode to Canterbury. I found
                Agnes alone by the fire, reading a book. I sat beside her and
                told her that I needed to speak to her privately. She nodded
                encouragingly. “My dear Agnes, do you have a secret? Please let
                me share it” , She trembled as she looked down, away from my
                face. She then jumped up and hurried across the room, bursting
                into tears. “You are wrong, Trotwood,” she cried. “I have no
                secrets from you.”

                “Agnes,” I cried as I went to her side. “I must say what is in
                my heart. You have always been my guide and my support, Agnes,
                When I loved Dora, my love would have been incomplete without

                I held her in my arms. She still wept, but joyfully now. She
                shyly told me that she had loved me her whole life. The next day
                we rode to Dover to tell my aunt the good news. We found her
                sitting by the fire.

                My aunt hugged and kissed us both. She was overjoyed. Peggotty
                hugged and kissed us both, as did Mr. Dick. My aunt said that
                she had always hoped that I would marry Agnes and it was me that
                she had meant when she said that she thought Agnes had a special
                friend. Unfortunately, I had been too <strong>blind</strong> to
                see it.

                Do you know what it was?” I thought I knew but asked my wife to
                continue. “She asked that I would look after you and become your
                wife,” said Agnes. I had been married for ten happy years and

                cried. “Are you alone?” asked Agnes, looking behind him for
                Emily. He said that he was and proceeded to tell us of their

                a <strong>magistrate</strong>. He had paid off all of his debts
                and was doing well for himself. Before Mr. Peggotty returned to
